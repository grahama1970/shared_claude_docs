# ðŸŒŸ GRANGER ECOSYSTEM FIX DIRECTIVE - CRITICAL

**Generated**: 2025-06-05 19:33:40
**Projects Requiring Fixes**: 3
**Total Issues**: 3

## ðŸŽ¯ ECOSYSTEM-WIDE FIXES REQUIRED

The Granger ecosystem verification has identified critical issues that MUST be fixed immediately. You are required to fix ALL issues in ALL projects listed below.

## ðŸ“Š ISSUE SUMMARY BY PROJECT


### world_model (1 issues)
- mock_usage_detected: 1 occurrences

### annotator (1 issues)
- mock_usage_detected: 1 occurrences

### aider-daemon (1 issues)
- mock_usage_detected: 1 occurrences

## ðŸ”§ FIXING STRATEGY


1. **Fix Projects in Order**: Start with projects that have the most issues
2. **Common Patterns**: Look for patterns across projects (e.g., all using mocks)
3. **Bulk Fixes**: Apply similar fixes across multiple projects when possible
4. **Test Continuously**: Run tests after each fix to verify progress

## ðŸ“‹ DETAILED FIX INSTRUCTIONS BY PROJECT

---
## Project: world_model
**Issues to fix**: 1

### Issue 1: mock_usage_detected
**Description**: Found mocks in 1 test files
**Evidence**: tests/test_honeypot.py


---
## Project: annotator
**Issues to fix**: 1

### Issue 1: mock_usage_detected
**Description**: Found mocks in 1 test files
**Evidence**: tests/active_learning/test_active_learning.py

## Project: aider-daemon
**Issues to fix**: 1

### Issue 1: mock_usage_detected
**Description**: Found mocks in 3 test files
**Evidence**: tests/smoke/test_honeypot.py, tests/unit/cli/test_session_listing.py, tests/unit/cli/test_print_mode.py


## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **REAL SYSTEMS ONLY**: No mocks, no fakes, no simulations
2. **VERIFY EVERYTHING**: Test after each fix
3. **DOCUMENT CHANGES**: Note what was fixed for future reference
4. **COMPLETE ALL FIXES**: Do not stop until all issues are resolved

## ðŸŽ¬ START NOW

Begin fixing immediately. Start with the project that has the most issues and work systematically through all projects. Do not wait for confirmation - these fixes are mandatory.

**YOUR SUCCESS IS MEASURED BY**: All tests passing with real systems, appropriate durations, and zero mock usage across the entire Granger ecosystem.
