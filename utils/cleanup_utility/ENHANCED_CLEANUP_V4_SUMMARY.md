# Enhanced Cleanup Utility v4 - Summary

## Overview

The Enhanced Cleanup Utility v4 is a comprehensive project maintenance tool designed for daily automated runs across all Claude companion projects. It combines Git safety, automatic fixes, and scenario testing.

## Key Features

### 1. **Git Safety**
- Automatically initializes Git repositories where missing
- Auto-commits uncommitted changes before processing
- Creates safety tags (`pre-cleanup-TIMESTAMP`) for rollback
- Works in feature branches, only merging on success
- Maintains full audit trail of all changes

### 2. **Automatic Fixes**
- **Dependency Installation**: Automatically installs missing Python packages based on import errors
- **TOML Syntax Fixes**: Repairs common syntax errors in pyproject.toml files
- **Module Structure**: Creates proper package structures (src/module_name/)
- **PYTHONPATH Cleanup**: Removes hardcoded paths from .env files
- **File Dependencies**: Converts file:/// dependencies to proper git URLs

### 3. **Comprehensive Validation**
- Import validation with automatic dependency resolution
- Documentation checks (README.md, CLAUDE.md)
- Test discovery and execution
- Code quality metrics (TODO counts, file sizes)
- Security scanning (hardcoded secrets)
- Inter-project communication testing

### 4. **Scenario Testing** (Optional)
- Runs interaction scenarios from docs/test_scenarios
- Tests real-world integration between projects
- Validates the entire ecosystem works together

## Usage

### Daily Automated Run (Recommended)
```bash
# Add to crontab for 6 AM daily execution
0 6 * * * /path/to/cleanup_utility/run_enhanced_cleanup_v4.sh --localhost --live --scenarios >> /path/to/cleanup_daily.log 2>&1
```

### Manual Runs

**Dry Run (Safe - Shows what would be changed):**
```bash
./run_enhanced_cleanup_v4.sh --localhost --verbose
```

**Live Run with Auto-Fix:**
```bash
./run_enhanced_cleanup_v4.sh --localhost --live
```

**Live Run with Scenarios:**
```bash
./run_enhanced_cleanup_v4.sh --localhost --live --scenarios
```

## Project-Specific Configurations

The utility knows about each project's requirements:

- **sparta**: Needs pydantic-settings, torch, transformers
- **marker**: Requires pydantic, CLI interface
- **arangodb**: Database project with connection testing
- **youtube_transcripts**: Needs youtube-dl, yt-dlp, whisper
- **claude_max_proxy**: Proxy with httpx, fastapi, uvicorn
- **arxiv-mcp-server**: MCP server with arxiv integration
- **granger_hub**: Central communication hub and orchestration
- **claude-test-reporter**: Testing framework dependency
- **fine_tuning**: Experimental with module structure fixes
- **marker-ground-truth**: Dataset project with numpy, pandas
- **mcp-screenshot**: Screenshot tool with mss, pillow

## Safety Features

1. **Never modifies main branch directly** - all changes go through feature branches
2. **Creates recovery tags** before any modifications
3. **Auto-commits prevent data loss** from uncommitted work
4. **Dry-run mode by default** - must explicitly enable live mode
5. **Detailed logging** of all operations and changes

## Reports Generated

After each run, find detailed reports in `cleanup_reports/`:

- `comprehensive_report_TIMESTAMP.md` - Full analysis with all details
- `summary_TIMESTAMP.txt` - Quick overview of results
- Individual JSON reports for each project

## Integration with Big Picture

The cleanup utility is designed to support the ecosystem described in `docs/big_picture/`:

1. **Maintains project health** across all 11+ registered projects
2. **Ensures inter-project compatibility** through communication tests
3. **Runs scenario tests** to validate real-world usage
4. **Supports the research pipeline** (SPARTA → Marker → ArangoDB)
5. **Keeps dependencies synchronized** across the ecosystem

## Common Issues Fixed Automatically

1. **Import Errors**: Missing packages are installed in project venvs
2. **Syntax Errors**: TOML files with unclosed quotes are repaired
3. **Module Structure**: Creates proper src/module_name/ directories
4. **Path Issues**: Removes hardcoded PYTHONPATH entries
5. **Git Issues**: Initializes repos and commits changes

## Rollback Instructions

If something goes wrong:

```bash
# List safety tags
cd /path/to/project
git tag -l 'pre-cleanup-*'

# Rollback to pre-cleanup state
git checkout pre-cleanup-TIMESTAMP
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Slack/Email notifications** for daily run results
2. **Performance metrics** tracking over time
3. **Automatic PR creation** for complex fixes
4. **Integration with CI/CD** pipelines
5. **Custom fix plugins** for project-specific issues

## Conclusion

The Enhanced Cleanup Utility v4 provides a robust, safe, and automated way to maintain the health of all Claude companion projects. By running it daily, you ensure:

- All projects remain buildable and testable
- Dependencies stay up to date
- Code quality issues are identified early
- The entire ecosystem remains functional

It's designed to be run unattended as part of your daily development workflow, keeping your projects in top shape with minimal manual intervention.
