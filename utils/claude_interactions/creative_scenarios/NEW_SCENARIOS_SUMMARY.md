- Dynamically adjust queries based on gaps identified

**Key Features**:
- ArXiv searches that become more refined each iteration
- Marker extracts insights that accumulate over time
- YouTube finds practical implementations
- Claude identifies knowledge gaps
- ArangoDB builds an evolving knowledge graph
- Quality scores improve with each iteration

### 2. ü§ñ Model Training Pipeline Scenario (`model_training_pipeline_scenario.py`)
**Pattern**: End-to-End ML Pipeline Coordination

Tests the communicator's ability to:
- Coordinate resource-intensive operations
- Manage sequential dependencies with checkpoints
- Transform data formats between modules
- Handle long-running tasks
- Track pipeline state

**Key Features**:
- Data collection from ArXiv and YouTube
- Document processing with Marker
- Dataset creation with Sparta
- Model training with Unsloth
- Validation with ground truth
- Deployment testing with Claude proxy

### 3. üèÜ Competitive Collaboration Scenario (`competitive_collaboration_scenario.py`)
**Pattern**: Competition + Collaboration Dynamics

Tests the communicator's ability to:
- Handle competitive module interactions
- Implement voting/scoring mechanisms
- Extract best practices from multiple approaches
- Facilitate collaborative improvement
- Benchmark performance

**Key Features**:
- Modules compete with individual solutions
- Peer review system where modules evaluate each other
- Best practices extraction
- Top performers collaborate
- Final showdown comparing individual vs collaborative solutions

## Benefits for Claude Module Communicator

These scenarios help ensure the communicator can:

1. **Handle Complex Workflows**: Not just simple A‚ÜíB‚ÜíC chains
2. **Manage State**: Track information across multiple module interactions
3. **Support Various Patterns**: Parallel, sequential, iterative, competitive
4. **Transform Data**: Convert between different module formats
5. **Coordinate Resources**: Manage compute-intensive operations
6. **Enable Feedback**: Use outputs to improve inputs
7. **Build Consensus**: Aggregate opinions from multiple modules
8. **Track Progress**: Monitor long-running operations

## Running the New Scenarios

Add these to `run_scenario_updated.sh`:

```bash
# New creative scenarios
knowledge_evolution|10)
    check_discovery_service
    run_scenario "Knowledge Evolution" "knowledge_evolution_scenario.py" "creative"
    ;;

model_pipeline|11)
    check_discovery_service
    run_scenario "Model Training Pipeline" "model_training_pipeline_scenario.py" "creative"
    ;;

competitive|12)
    check_discovery_service
    run_scenario "Competitive Collaboration" "competitive_collaboration_scenario.py" "creative"
    ;;
```

## Key Takeaway

These scenarios demonstrate that the claude-module-communicator should be flexible enough to handle:
- **State Management**: Maintaining context across interactions
- **Dynamic Routing**: Adjusting module calls based on results
- **Parallel Coordination**: Managing multiple simultaneous operations
- **Error Recovery**: Handling failures gracefully
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitoring and optimizing workflows
- **Resource Allocation**: Managing compute-intensive tasks

The communicator becomes not just a message passer, but an intelligent orchestrator capable of complex multi-module workflows.
