# Creative Module Interaction Scenarios

These scenarios explore novel ways modules can communicate and collaborate, going beyond traditional request-response patterns.

## Scenarios

### 🎼 Symphony Scenario ()
Modules work in parallel like musicians in an orchestra, synchronizing at key moments to create harmonious results.

### 🔍 Detective Scenario () 
Modules collaborate as specialized detectives, sharing clues on an evidence board to solve mysteries together.

### 🌳 Ecosystem Scenario ()
Modules form symbiotic relationships, producing and consuming resources from each other in a self-regulating system.

### 🪞 Mirror Scenario ()
Each module reflects and creatively transforms the previous module's output, revealing new dimensions of understanding.

## Running Scenarios



## Key Patterns

- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple modules working simultaneously
- **Shared State**: Persistent context all modules can access
- **Resource Exchange**: Abstract resource production/consumption
- **Creative Transformation**: Non-linear, imaginative data modifications
- **Emergent Behavior**: System properties beyond individual capabilities
