## Module Status

- **ArangoDB Module**: ✅ Available
- **Connection**: Connected

## Integration Features

1. **Document Operations**: Full CRUD with automatic embedding generation
2. **Search Capabilities**: 
   - BM25 text search
   - Semantic vector search  
   - Hybrid search combining both
3. **Graph Database**: Edges, traversal, pathfinding
4. **Memory Agent**: Conversation tracking with temporal awareness
5. **Paper Management**: Specialized handlers for research papers

## Known Issues

- Semantic search requires embeddings to be pre-generated
- Graph operations require proper collection setup
- Memory agent needs specific collections created

## Verification

All passing tests used real ArangoDB operations with actual database queries.

## Overall Result

**Tests Passed**: 4/6 (67%)

⚠️ **Some ArangoDB handlers are working, but there are issues to address.**
