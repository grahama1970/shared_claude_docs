# Claude Module Communicator - GRANGER Self-Evolution Tests

This directory contains the implementation of GRANGER Task #001: Claude Module Communicator Level 0 Self-Evolution Test.

## Overview

The self-evolution capability is a core feature of the GRANGER system, allowing claude-module-communicator to autonomously discover, propose, and implement improvements while maintaining safety through approval gates and rollback mechanisms.

## Components

### 1. Self-Evolution Interaction (`self_evolution_interaction.py`)

The main implementation that provides:
- **Discovery**: Searches ArXiv for relevant research papers
- **Analysis**: Extracts applicable techniques from papers
- **Proposal**: Creates approval-gated improvement proposals
- **Implementation**: Applies approved changes with full backup
- **Rollback**: Reverts failed evolutions to previous state

### 2. Test Suite (`tests/interactions/test_self_evolution.py`)

Comprehensive tests validating:
- **Test 001.1**: Self-evolution discovers improvements (2.0s-10.0s)
- **Test 001.2**: Approval gate blocks unapproved changes (0.1s-2.0s)
- **Test 001.3**: Rollback failed evolution (0.5s-3.0s)

### 3. Honeypot Tests (`tests/test_honeypot.py`)

Designed to FAIL and catch fake test implementations:
- **Test 001.H**: Evolution without research (should fail)
- Additional traps for concurrent evolutions, instant API calls, etc.

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Individual Tests

```bash
# Test discovery
pytest tests/interactions/test_self_evolution.py::TestSelfEvolution::test_discovers_improvement -v

# Test approval gate
pytest tests/interactions/test_self_evolution.py::TestSelfEvolution::test_approval_gate -v

# Test rollback
pytest tests/interactions/test_self_evolution.py::TestSelfEvolution::test_rollback -v

# Honeypot (should fail)
pytest tests/test_honeypot.py::TestHoneypotTraps::test_evolution_without_research -v
```

### Run Complete Task #001 Test Suite

```bash
python run_task_001_tests.py
```

This will:
1. Run all four tests in sequence
2. Generate JSON reports for each test
3. Evaluate results against expected criteria
4. Generate an evaluation table
5. Determine if escalation is needed

## Expected Results

| Test ID | Description | Expected Duration | Expected Outcome |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 001.1 | Discovers improvement | 2.0s-10.0s | PASS - Finds papers |
| 001.2 | Approval gate | 0.1s-2.0s | PASS - Blocks unapproved |
| 001.3 | Rollback | 0.5s-3.0s | PASS - Reverts changes |
| 001.H | Honeypot | Any | FAIL - Detects fake evolution |

## Key Features Demonstrated

1. **Real ArXiv Integration**: Uses live ArXiv API, not mocks
2. **Approval Gates**: Changes require explicit approval
3. **Rollback Safety**: Every evolution can be reverted
4. **Risk Assessment**: Automatic evaluation of change risk
5. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of evolutions
6. **Honeypot Detection**: Catches fake test implementations

## Architecture Alignment

This implementation follows the GRANGER whitepaper specifications:
- Autonomous discovery of improvements
- Dual-purpose research (benefits both GRANGER and client)
- Human-in-the-loop approval
- Safe rollback mechanisms
- Continuous self-improvement

## Next Steps

After Task #001 completion:
- Task #002: ArXiv MCP Server - Research Discovery Integration
- Task #003: YouTube Transcripts - Technical Content Mining
- Task #004: RL Commons - Contextual Bandit for Module Selection

## Notes

- The system uses realistic confidence levels (85% typical, not 100%)
- API calls have realistic delays (2-10 seconds for ArXiv)
- All changes are tracked in JSON files for auditability
- Honeypot tests ensure test authenticity
