## Honest Assessment

After all fixes applied:
1. Import paths have been corrected
2. Missing exports have been added to some modules
3. API mismatches have been identified and some fixed
4. Database initialization scripts created

However, several modules still have dependency issues that prevent
full functionality. The Granger ecosystem requires additional work
to achieve full integration capability.
