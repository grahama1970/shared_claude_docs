## Critical Verification Verdict

**Tests Passed**: 4/5 (80%)

### Analysis
- ✅ ArXiv API calls are genuine (not mocked)
- ✅ PDF downloads are real network operations
- ❌ Some operations completed unrealistically fast

### Final Verdict

⚠️ **MOSTLY VERIFIED** - Pipeline is largely functional but has some concerns.

*Note: Marker conversion is simulated in this test. Real Marker integration would require the actual Marker module.*
