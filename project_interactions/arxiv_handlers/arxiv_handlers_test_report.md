Generated: 2025-06-03 21:42:39

## Test Summary

| Handler | Test Result | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Search Handler | ✅ PASS | Search papers by query |
| Download Handler | ✅ PASS | Download PDF files |
| Citation Handler | ✅ PASS | Find citing papers |
| Evidence Handler | ✅ PASS | Find supporting/contradicting evidence |
| Batch Handler | ✅ PASS | Process multiple operations |

## Library Status

- **arxiv**: ✅ Available
- **requests**: ✅ Available

## Integration Notes

1. All handlers use the real arxiv Python library
2. API calls are made to actual ArXiv servers
3. Response times indicate real network operations
4. PDF downloads are actual files from ArXiv

## Known Issues

- Citation discovery is approximate (ArXiv doesn't provide direct citation data)
- Evidence extraction relies on keyword matching in abstracts
- Rate limiting may apply for large batch operations

## Verification

All tests that passed used real ArXiv API calls with realistic response times (>0.1s for search, >0.5s for downloads).

## Overall Result

**Tests Passed**: 5/5 (100%)

✅ **All ArXiv handlers are working correctly with real API integration.**
