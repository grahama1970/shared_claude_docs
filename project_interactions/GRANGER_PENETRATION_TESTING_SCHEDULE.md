# GRANGER Penetration Testing Schedule & Framework

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the penetration testing schedule for the Granger ecosystem, including scope, methodology, timeline, and success criteria. Testing will be conducted by external security professionals to validate our security implementation.

## Testing Philosophy

1. **Independent Verification** - External testers with no prior knowledge of fixes
2. **Real-World Attacks** - Simulate actual threat actors and techniques
3. **Progressive Intensity** - Start with automated scans, escalate to manual testing
4. **Continuous Improvement** - Each round informs the next
5. **Evidence-Based** - All findings must be reproducible
