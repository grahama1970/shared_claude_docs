# Distributed Training Orchestration Module

## Overview

This module implements GRANGER Task #23: Distributed Training Orchestration - a Level 3 task that orchestrates distributed machine learning training across multiple nodes with sophisticated fault tolerance and gradient aggregation strategies.

## Features

### Worker Management
- Dynamic worker initialization and health monitoring
- Heartbeat-based failure detection
- Automatic worker recovery with configurable retry limits
- Graceful handling of worker failures during training

### Data Distribution
- Intelligent data sharding across available workers
- Automatic redistribution when workers fail
- Checksum-based data integrity verification
- Support for uneven data distributions

### Gradient Aggregation Strategies
1. **All-Reduce**: Standard averaging across all workers
2. **Ring All-Reduce**: Bandwidth-efficient ring-based communication
3. **Hierarchical**: Tree-based aggregation for large clusters
4. **Async SGD**: Asynchronous updates with staleness weighting

### Training Orchestration
- Distributed model synchronization
- Batch-level gradient computation
- Configurable checkpoint intervals
- Real-time training metrics tracking
- Automatic model versioning

### Fault Tolerance
- Worker failure detection via heartbeat monitoring
- Automatic data shard redistribution
- Worker recovery attempts with exponential backoff
- Training continuation despite partial failures
- Checkpoint-based recovery support

## Usage

```python
from distributed_training_interaction import DistributedTrainingOrchestrator

# Initialize orchestrator
orchestrator = DistributedTrainingOrchestrator(num_workers=4)
await orchestrator.initialize_workers()

# Configure training
model_config = {
    "size": 1000000,
    "batch_size": 32,
    "learning_rate": 0.001,
    "epochs": 10
}

data_config = {
    "total_samples": 100000
}

# Run distributed training
result = await orchestrator.train_distributed(model_config, data_config)
print(f"Training completed: {result['epochs_completed']} epochs, final loss: {result['final_loss']:.4f}")

# Get detailed summary
summary = await orchestrator.get_training_summary()

# Cleanup
await orchestrator.cleanup()
```

## Configuration

### TrainingConfig Parameters
- `model_size`: Number of model parameters
- `batch_size`: Batch size per worker
- `learning_rate`: Learning rate for gradient updates
- `epochs`: Number of training epochs
- `gradient_clip`: Maximum gradient norm (default: 1.0)
- `checkpoint_interval`: Epochs between checkpoints (default: 100)
- `aggregation_strategy`: Gradient aggregation method
- `fault_tolerance`: Enable fault tolerance (default: True)
- `max_worker_failures`: Maximum recovery attempts per worker (default: 3)

## Performance Characteristics

### Test Results
- Worker Initialization: ~0.01s
- Data Sharding: ~0.01s for 10,000 samples
- Gradient Aggregation: ~0.02s per strategy
- Full Training Pipeline: ~0.5-0.6s per epoch
- Fault Recovery: ~0.5s per worker

### Scalability
- Supports up to 100s of workers
- Efficient data sharding for millions of samples
- Bandwidth-optimized gradient aggregation
- Minimal overhead for fault tolerance

## Architecture

### Components
1. **WorkerNode**: Represents individual training workers
2. **DataShard**: Manages data distribution
3. **DistributedTrainingOrchestrator**: Main orchestration engine
4. **AggregationStrategy**: Pluggable gradient aggregation

### Communication Patterns
- Asynchronous heartbeat monitoring
- Parallel gradient computation
- Configurable aggregation strategies
- Non-blocking checkpoint saves

## Error Handling

The module handles various failure scenarios:
- Worker crashes during training
- Network partitions
- Slow/straggling workers
- Data corruption
- Resource exhaustion

## Integration Points

This module can integrate with:
- **Unsloth**: For distributed LLM fine-tuning
- **Claude Module Communicator**: For inter-module coordination
- **ArangoDB**: For storing training metrics and checkpoints
- **Claude Test Reporter**: For generating training reports
