# Progressive Deployment and Rollback System

This module implements GRANGER Task #20 - a Level 3 complexity task for progressive deployment with real-time monitoring and automatic rollback capabilities.

## Features

### Deployment Strategies

1. **Canary Deployment**
   - Progressive traffic shifting (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
   - Health monitoring at each stage
   - Automatic rollback on threshold violations

2. **Blue-Green Deployment**
   - Instant traffic switching
   - Pre-deployment health validation
   - Instant rollback capability

3. **Feature Flag Deployment**
   - Granular feature control
   - Progressive feature enablement
   - Individual feature rollback

### Monitoring Capabilities

- Real-time health metrics collection
- Configurable health thresholds
- Automatic violation detection
- Metrics aggregation and history

### Health Metrics Tracked

- Response time (ms)
- Error rate (%)
- Success rate (%)
- CPU usage (%)
- Memory usage (%)
- Active connections

### Rollback Mechanisms

- Automatic rollback on health violations
- Configurable violation thresholds
- Instant rollback for blue-green
- Progressive rollback for canary

## Usage Examples

### Canary Deployment

```python
from progressive_deployment_interaction import ProgressiveDeploymentSystem

deployer = ProgressiveDeploymentSystem()

# Deploy with 10% traffic increments
result = deployer.deploy_with_canary("service-v2.0", traffic_percentage=10)

print(f"Status: {result['status']}")
print(f"Duration: {result.get('duration', 'N/A')}")
```

### Blue-Green Deployment

```python
# Instant switch deployment
result = deployer.deploy_blue_green("service-v3.0")

print(f"Status: {result['status']}")
print(f"Switch Time: {result.get('switch_time', 'N/A')}")
```

### Feature Flag Deployment

```python
# Deploy with specific features
feature_flags = {
    "new_ui": True,
    "advanced_analytics": True,
    "experimental_feature": False
}

result = deployer.deploy_with_feature_flags("service-v4.0", feature_flags)

print(f"Status: {result['status']}")
print(f"Enabled Features: {result.get('enabled_features', [])}")
```

## Configuration

### Deployment Configuration Options

```python
from progressive_deployment_interaction import DeploymentConfig, DeploymentStrategy

config = DeploymentConfig(
    service_name="my-service",
    version="v2.0",
    strategy=DeploymentStrategy.CANARY,
    health_check_interval_seconds=10,
    monitoring_duration_minutes=30,
    rollback_threshold_violations=3,
    traffic_increment_percentage=10,
    health_thresholds={
        "max_response_time_ms": 1000,
        "max_error_rate": 0.05,
        "min_success_rate": 0.95,
        "max_cpu_usage": 0.80,
        "max_memory_usage": 0.85
    }
)
```

## Testing

The module includes comprehensive tests for all deployment strategies:

```bash
python progressive_deployment_interaction.py
```

### Test Coverage

1. **Canary Deployment Success** - Tests successful progressive deployment
2. **Canary Deployment Rollback** - Tests automatic rollback on failures
3. **Blue-Green Instant Switch** - Tests instant traffic switching
4. **Feature Flag Progressive** - Tests feature-by-feature enablement
5. **Monitoring and Metrics** - Tests health monitoring system
6. **State Persistence** - Tests deployment state saving/loading

## Deployment State Management

All deployments are tracked with:
- Unique deployment IDs
- Complete event history
- Metrics history
- Rollback tracking
- Persistent state storage

### State Storage

Deployment states are saved to JSON files in the `./deployment_state/` directory:

```json
{
  "deployment_id": "deploy-1234567890",
  "config": { ... },
  "status": "completed",
  "start_time": "2024-01-01T12:00:00",
  "end_time": "2024-01-01T12:30:00",
  "current_traffic_percentage": 100,
  "health_violations": [],
  "rollback_count": 0,
  "metrics_history": [ ... ],
  "events": [ ... ]
}
```

## Integration Points

This module is designed to integrate with:

1. **CI/CD Pipelines** - Automated deployment workflows
2. **Monitoring Systems** - External metrics collection
3. **Alert Systems** - Notification on rollbacks
4. **Service Meshes** - Traffic management
5. **Feature Flag Services** - Dynamic configuration

## Safety Features

1. **Automatic Rollback** - Triggered on health violations
2. **Progressive Traffic Shifting** - Minimizes blast radius
3. **Health Validation** - Continuous monitoring
4. **State Persistence** - Recovery from failures
5. **Event Logging** - Complete audit trail

## Performance Considerations

- Asynchronous monitoring for non-blocking operations
- Configurable check intervals to balance load
- Metrics aggregation to reduce storage
- Bounded history collections (deque with maxlen)

## Future Enhancements

1. **A/B Testing Support** - Statistical significance testing
2. **Multi-Region Deployment** - Geographic rollout
3. **Custom Health Checks** - Pluggable health validators
4. **Webhook Notifications** - External system integration
5. **Deployment Approval Gates** - Manual approval steps
