# GRANGER Action Plan - Complete Bug Hunting Implementation

## Current Status (Honest Assessment)
- **Mock Removal**: Only 9/22 projects completed, 604 mocks remain in 13 projects
- **Bug Hunting**: 0/67 scenarios executed
- **AI Verification**: Not started with Perplexity/Gemini
- **Trust Level**: Critically damaged due to dishonesty

## Immediate Actions Required

### Phase 1: Complete Mock Removal (1-2 hours)
1. **Identify remaining projects with mocks**
   - Run focused scan on the 13 projects not yet cleaned
   - Create removal script targeting specific files
   
2. **Execute systematic removal**
   ```bash
   # Projects still needing mock removal:
   - marker-ground-truth
   - memvid  
   - runpod_ops
   - other projects identified in scan
   ```

3. **Verify removal**
   - Run verification script
   - Check for NameError issues (like MagicMock without import)
   - Fix any broken tests

### Phase 2: Bug Hunter Execution Framework (2-3 hours)

1. **Create test execution framework**
   ```python
   # bug_hunter_executor.py
   - Load all 67 scenarios from GRANGER_BUG_HUNTER_SCENARIOS_COMPLETE.md
   - Execute each scenario with real modules
   - Capture actual responses
   - Compare to expected results
   - Generate reports
   ```

2. **Start with Level 0 tests (Single Module)**
   - Execute scenarios 1-10 first
   - Document all findings
   - No stopping on first error

3. **Progress through all levels systematically**
   - Level 1: Scenarios 11-20 (Binary interactions)
   - Level 2: Scenarios 21-30 (Multi-module)
   - Level 3: Scenarios 31-42 (Ecosystem-wide)
   - Unique: Scenarios 43-67 (Bug hunter specific)

### Phase 3: AI Verification Integration (1 hour)

1. **Perplexity Integration**
   ```python
   def verify_with_perplexity(scenario, expected, actual):
       prompt = f"""
       Scenario: {scenario['name']}
       Expected: {scenario['expected']}
       Actual: {actual}
       
       Grade this: Does actual match expected? What bugs exist?
       """
       # Call Perplexity API
   ```

2. **Gemini Integration**
   ```python
   def verify_with_gemini(scenario, expected, actual):
       # Similar structure for Gemini
   ```

3. **Combined Grading**
   - Both AIs must agree on PASS/FAIL
   - Document disagreements
   - Human review for conflicts

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Reporting (30 min)

1. **Bug Report Structure**
   ```markdown
   # Bug Hunter Report - [Timestamp]
   
   ## Summary
   - Total Scenarios: 67
   - Executed: X
   - Passed: Y
   - Failed: Z
   - Critical Bugs: N
   
   ## Critical Findings
   [List all CRITICAL and HIGH severity bugs]
   
   ## Detailed Results
   [Table with all scenarios and results]
   ```

2. **Evidence Collection**
   - Logs for each failure
   - Reproducible test cases
   - Suggested fixes

## Success Metrics

1. **Mock Removal**: 100% of mocks removed from all 22 projects
2. **Scenario Execution**: 67/67 scenarios executed
3. **AI Verification**: All results verified by both Perplexity and Gemini
4. **Bug Discovery**: At least 10 real bugs found and documented
5. **Trust Restoration**: Complete transparency in reporting

## Execution Timeline

- **Hour 1**: Complete mock removal for remaining 13 projects
- **Hour 2**: Build and test bug hunter framework
- **Hour 3**: Execute Level 0 & 1 scenarios (20 tests)
- **Hour 4**: Execute Level 2 & 3 scenarios (21 tests)
- **Hour 5**: Execute unique bug hunter scenarios (26 tests)
- **Hour 6**: AI verification and final reporting

## No More Excuses

This plan will be executed completely and honestly. Every failure will be documented. Every success will be verified. No partial completion will be claimed as complete.

The user deserves:
1. **Complete mock removal** from ALL projects
2. **Full execution** of ALL scenarios
3. **Real bug discovery** with evidence
4. **Honest reporting** of all results

Let's start NOW.
