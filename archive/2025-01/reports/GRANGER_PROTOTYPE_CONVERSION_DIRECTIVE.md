# Granger Prototype Conversion Directive

## Critical Update (2025-01-07)

The granger-feature-sync command has been enhanced with stronger directives to ensure skeleton projects are converted to WORKING Granger components, not merely marked as prototypes.

## Key Changes

### 1. Enhanced Skeleton Detection
- Detects projects with <30% real implementation
- Identifies missing Granger ecosystem connections
- Tracks interaction capabilities for each module

### 2. Interaction Requirements Enforcement
Every module MUST now demonstrate:
- Connection to Granger Hub
- Connection to at least 1 other module (2+ total connections)
- Message handling capabilities
- Standard message format implementation
- Real interaction tests that prove modules work together

### 3. Updated Implementation Directives
When skeleton or isolated projects are detected:
- **MARKING AS PROTOTYPE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE**
- Projects MUST be converted to working components
- Each module MUST implement >70% real code
- Each module MUST pass interaction tests
- Each module MUST be usable in Granger scenarios

### 4. Generated Code Enhancements
The auto-generated implementation code now includes:
- Granger Hub integration
- Message handler implementation
- Connection to required modules based on architecture
- Standard message format support
- Interaction test suite with:
  - Hub connection tests
  - Module interaction tests
  - Message handling tests
  - Real timing validation

### 5. Report Improvements
Feature sync reports now show:
- Skeleton project warnings with specific requirements
- Isolated project detection
- Interaction capabilities for each module
- Connected modules count
- Test level achievements

## Usage

```bash
# Analyze all projects and get directive
/granger-feature-sync

# Auto-implement missing features with interaction support
/granger-feature-sync --implement
```

## Critical Requirements

1. **NO PROTOTYPES** - All modules must be working components
2. **CONNECTIVITY** - Every module connects to 2+ other modules
3. **REAL CODE** - >70% implementation, no skeleton functions
4. **INTERACTION TESTS** - Prove modules actually communicate
5. **ECOSYSTEM READY** - Usable in real Granger scenarios

## Enforcement

The command will:
- Show "IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE ACTIVATED" when issues found
- List specific requirements for each skeleton project
- Generate implementation code with Hub integration
- Create interaction tests automatically
- Track progress until all modules are ecosystem-ready

## Next Steps

1. Run `/granger-feature-sync` to identify skeleton projects
2. Follow the MANDATORY implementation requirements
3. Convert ALL skeleton projects to working components
4. Ensure each module passes interaction tests
5. Verify ecosystem connectivity before marking complete

Remember: The goal is a fully integrated Granger ecosystem where every module is a functioning part of the whole, not a collection of isolated prototypes.
