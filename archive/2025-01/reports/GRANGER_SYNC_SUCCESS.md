# Granger Ecosystem Sync Success Report

## Summary

Successfully completed `uv sync` and installed `shared_claude_docs` in editable mode with a partial set of Granger ecosystem dependencies.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Repository URLs
- Changed `sparta` → `SPARTA` (uppercase)
- Changed `rl-commons` → `rl_commons` (pending your upstream fix)

### 2. Fixed Package Names
- Changed `annotator` → `active-annotator`
- Changed `aider-daemon` → `aider-chat`

### 3. Updated Requirements
- Changed Python requirement from `>=3.10` to `>=3.10.11` (required by arxiv-mcp-server)
- Changed aiohttp from `>=3.12.6` to `>=3.11.18` (required by aider-chat)
- Set numpy to `>=1.24.0,<2` (compromise between packages)

### 4. Configured Authentication
- Set up Git to use SSH for GitHub: `git config --global url."git@github.com:".insteadOf "https://github.com/"`

## Currently Installed Packages

✅ Successfully installed:
- granger_hub
- rl_commons (as rl-commons)
- claude-test-reporter
- sparta
- youtube_transcripts
- arxiv-mcp-server
- mcp-screenshot
- active-annotator

❌ Temporarily disabled due to conflicts:
- arangodb (numpy >=2.2.2 conflict)
- marker (surya-ocr version conflict with granger-hub)
- fine_tuning (broken submodule)
- aider-chat (numpy version conflict)
- memvid (not tested)

## Next Steps

1. **Fix arangodb pyproject.toml on GitHub**
   - The fix is ready locally but needs to be pushed
   - Run: `gh auth login` then push from `/home/graham/workspace/experiments/arangodb`

2. **Resolve Package Conflicts**
   - Update marker to support newer surya-ocr versions
   - Update arangodb numpy requirement or marker to support numpy 2.x
   - Fix fine_tuning submodule issue

3. **Update rl_commons**
   - Change package name from `rl-commons` to `rl_commons` in its pyproject.toml for consistency

## Testing

You can now use shared_claude_docs:
```python
import shared_claude_docs
# Your code here
```

## Working Configuration

The current pyproject.toml has these packages commented out:
- marker (surya-ocr conflict)
- arangodb (numpy 2.x requirement)
- fine_tuning (broken submodule)
- aider-chat (numpy conflict)

With these commented out, the rest of the Granger ecosystem installs successfully.
