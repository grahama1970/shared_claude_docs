## SPARTA CVE Search

**Expected**:
- Should return structured CVE data with fields: ID, description, severity, affected systems
- Response time 1-5 seconds for typical query
- Empty results for non-existent CVEs with clear message
- Handle malformed CVE IDs gracefully

**Actual**:
```
Test 1 (Valid CVE): Duration=0.579383s
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 4, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sparta.cybersecurity_kb'


Test 2 (Non-existent CVE): Duration=0.581173s  
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 4, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sparta.cybersecurity_kb'


Test 3 (Malformed CVE):
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 4, in <module>
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sparta.cybersecurity_kb'

```

**Gemini Verification**:
1. **NO**

2. **Bugs/Issues:** The primary issue indicated is a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sparta.cybersecurity_kb'`. This error consistently appears across all three test cases (valid CVE, non-existent CVE, and malformed CVE).  This suggests a fundamental problem with the module import process within the `sparta` module.  The tests themselves don't appear to be faulty; rather, the underlying code is failing to locate and import the necessary `cybersecurity_kb` module.  This could be due to several reasons:

    * **Incorrect module path:** The `sparta.cybersecurity_kb` module might not exist at the expected location within the `sparta` package.  The path might be misspelled in the import statement, or the module might be located in a different directory.
    * **Missing module:** The `cybersecurity_kb` module might be missing entirely from the project. This could be due to a failure during installation, a missing dependency, or a simple oversight in the project's structure.
    * **Installation issue:** The `sparta` package itself might not be correctly installed, leading to the inability to import its submodules.  This could be related to environment variables, virtual environments, or package manager issues.
    * **Incorrect import statement:** There might be a typo or other error in the import statement within the test code or the main `sparta` code.

3. **Severity: CRITICAL**

The `ModuleNotFoundError` prevents *any* functionality of the CVE data retrieval and parsing from working.  This is a complete failure of the core functionality, making the entire system unusable.  Therefore, it's classified as CRITICAL.

4. **Broken/Missing Functionality:** The entire CVE data retrieval and parsing functionality is broken.  The system cannot access or process any CVE data because it cannot import the `sparta.cybersecurity_kb` module, which is presumably essential for this process.  None of the expected results (structured data, response time, handling of empty results, or graceful handling of malformed IDs) are achievable due to this fundamental import error.

## ArXiv Paper Search

**Expected**:
- Returns list of papers with title, authors, abstract, PDF URL
- Handles special characters in queries (e.g., "Müller", "∇f(x)")
- Pagination works correctly for large result sets
- Empty query returns error, not all papers

**Actual**:
```
Test 1 (Normal search): Found 5 papers
First paper: The Rise of Quantum Internet Computing

Test 2 (Special chars): Found 0 papers  
First paper: No results

Test 3 (Empty query): Got 0 results
```

**Gemini Verification**:
1. **NO**

2. **Bugs/Issues:**

* **Bug 1: Failure to handle special characters:** Test 2 demonstrates a critical failure. The system fails to return any results when the search query contains special characters like "Müller" or "∇f(x)". This indicates a problem in the query parsing or database interaction, likely stemming from improper encoding or escaping of special characters within the search query.  The absence of an error message further exacerbates the issue, making debugging more difficult.

* **Bug 2:  Incorrect handling of empty queries:** Test 3 shows that an empty query returns zero results instead of an appropriate error message. While returning an empty set might seem acceptable at first glance, the specification explicitly states that an empty query should return an error, not simply an empty result set. This suggests a lack of input validation or error handling for empty search terms.  This could be a security vulnerability if exploited.

* **Bug 3: (Potential) Incomplete Metadata Extraction (Unconfirmed):** While Test 1 shows some results, the report only provides the title of the first paper.  The expected result includes authors, abstract, and PDF URL.  The report doesn't confirm if these metadata fields were correctly extracted for the five papers found.  This requires further investigation.  This is a potential bug, but not confirmed based on the provided information.


3. **Severity: HIGH**

The failure to handle special characters (Bug 1) is a HIGH severity issue because it significantly limits the functionality of the search system.  Many research papers include special characters in their titles or author names, rendering a large portion of the database inaccessible. The improper handling of empty queries (Bug 2) is also a HIGH severity issue due to potential security implications and the violation of the specified behavior.  The potential metadata extraction issue (Bug 3) is considered a MEDIUM severity until confirmed.


4. **Broken/Missing Functionality:**

* **Special character handling in search queries:** The system's ability to correctly parse and search for papers containing special characters in their titles, authors, or abstracts is broken.
* **Error handling for empty search queries:** The system lacks proper error handling for empty search queries, violating the specified behavior.
* **(Potentially) Complete metadata extraction:** The system may be failing to extract all expected metadata (authors, abstract, PDF URL) for search results.  This needs further investigation.
