## 📋 Compliance Status After Fixes

| Category | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Python Version Compliant | 6/17 (35%) | 16/16 (100%)* |
| Numpy Version Compliant | 1/11 (9%) | 11/11 (100%) |
| Pandas Version Compliant | 0/8 (0%) | 8/8 (100%) |
| PyArrow Included | 0/8 (0%) | 8/8 (100%) |

*Excluding llm_call which is being containerized

## 🎯 Remaining Work

1. **llm_call** - Excluded from fixes as it's being converted to Docker container
2. **Test Verification** - Run tests for each project to ensure no regressions
3. **3-Layer Architecture** - Already verified as compliant for checked projects
