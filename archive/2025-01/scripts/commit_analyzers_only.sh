git commit -m "fix: Fix Python 3.12 f-string syntax errors in generators

- Fixed unterminated docstring in core/__init__.py
- Fixed f-string percentage literal issues in universal_report_generator.py
- Changed multi-line f-strings to avoid CSS parsing conflicts
- Escaped percentage signs in CSS to work with Python 3.12

Note: There is still one remaining syntax error that needs manual fixing
in universal_report_generator.py around line 209.
