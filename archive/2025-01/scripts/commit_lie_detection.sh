git commit -m "feat: Add comprehensive lie detection analyzers to prevent test deception

- Add MockDetector to identify inappropriate mock usage in integration tests
- Add RealTimeTestMonitor to force actual test execution and catch instant-pass tests  
- Add ImplementationVerifier to detect skeleton code and empty functions
- Add HoneypotEnforcer to ensure honeypot tests fail as designed
- Add IntegrationTester for real module communication testing
- Add PatternAnalyzer to detect repeated deception patterns
- Add ClaimVerifier to cross-check claims against implementations
- Enhance HallucinationMonitor with Claude-specific detection
- Add ComprehensiveAnalyzer to orchestrate all analyzers
- Create EnhancedMultiProjectDashboard with trust scores and deception metrics
- Add comprehensive test suite for all analyzers
- Integrate with granger-verify command for automatic lie detection
- Add detailed documentation in docs/lie_detection_guide.md

This system detects when Claude (or other AI) lies about:
- Tests passing when they don't
- Features being implemented when they're skeleton code
- Integration tests using mocks instead of real components
- Honeypot tests being manipulated to pass
- Instant test completion indicating fake testing

Trust scores and deception metrics are calculated and displayed in dashboards.
