Module: remove_all_mocks_from_granger.py
Description: Remove all mock usage from Granger projects to comply with NO MOCKS policy

External Dependencies:
- pathlib: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html

Sample Input:
>>> # Run from shared_claude_docs directory
>>> python remove_all_mocks_from_granger.py

Expected Output:
>>> Removing mocks from granger_hub...
>>> Fixed: tests/test_hub.py - removed 5 mock imports
>>> ... (more fixes)
>>> ‚úÖ All mocks removed successfully

Example Usage:
>>> python remove_all_mocks_from_granger.py
