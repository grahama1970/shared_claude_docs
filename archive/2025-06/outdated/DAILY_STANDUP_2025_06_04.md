**Phase**: UI Foundation & Migration  

---

## 🎯 Yesterday (June 3)

### Completed ✅
1. **UI-007: Create Full Component Library**
   - Built 5 core web components (Input, Select, Modal, Table, Toast)
   - All components follow 2025 Style Guide
   - Full TypeScript support

2. **UI-008: Terminal UI Equivalents**
   - Created 7 terminal components with Ink
   - Maintained API consistency across platforms
   - Implemented ASCII tables and focus management

3. **Build Configuration Progress**
   - Installed pnpm locally
   - Successfully built ui-core and ui-web packages
   - Identified terminal build issues (React version conflicts)

4. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive progress tracking
   - Developed Chat migration plan
   - Documented all component APIs

### Blockers Encountered
- Terminal package has ESM/CommonJS conflicts
- React version mismatch (v18 for web, v19 for Ink)
- Module resolution issues with TypeScript

## 🚀 Today (June 4)

### Morning Focus
1. **Complete Web Showcase Application**
   - ✅ Created Next.js structure
   - ✅ Built comprehensive component showcase page
   - ✅ Added usage examples and code snippets
   - Need to test with `pnpm dev`

2. **Begin Chat Migration (UI-009)**
   - ✅ Created migration script for Button component
   - Created compatibility wrapper approach
   - Next: Execute migration and test

3. **Storybook Setup (UI-012)**
   - ✅ Created basic Storybook configuration
   - Need to add component stories
   - Document component variations

### Afternoon Goals
1. **Fix Terminal Build**
   - Try alternative bundlers (esbuild, tsup)
   - Consider using separate package for React 19

2. **Chat Migration Phase 1**
   - Add @granger/ui-web to Chat dependencies
   - Test Button compatibility wrapper
   - Begin Card component migration

3. **Documentation**
   - Create component usage guide
   - Add migration instructions
   - Update task progress

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

1. **Migration Strategy**: Compatibility wrappers for gradual migration
2. **Build Tools**: Rollup for web, exploring alternatives for terminal
3. **Testing**: Need to set up visual regression tests
4. **Documentation**: Storybook for interactive component docs

## 🚨 Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Terminal Build Complexity
- **Impact**: Delays terminal UI implementation
- **Mitigation**: Focus on web components first, explore pre-built terminal package

### Risk 2: Breaking Changes During Migration
- **Impact**: Chat interface instability
- **Mitigation**: Compatibility wrappers, feature flags, extensive testing

### Risk 3: Bundle Size Increase
- **Impact**: Performance degradation
- **Mitigation**: Tree shaking, code splitting, lazy loading

## 📞 Communication

- **Blockers**: Terminal build issues need architecture decision
- **Help Needed**: Review of migration strategy
- **Demo Ready**: Web showcase application

---

## ✅ Definition of Done for Today

- [ ] Web showcase runs successfully
- [ ] At least one Chat component migrated
- [ ] Storybook shows all components
- [ ] Terminal build issue documented with options
- [ ] Progress updated in task tracker

## 📝 Notes

The UI unification is progressing well despite build challenges. The component library is feature-complete for web, and the migration strategy is solid. Focus today is on proving the migration approach works with the Chat interface.

**Confidence Level**: 85% - High confidence in approach, some uncertainty on terminal build resolution timeline.
