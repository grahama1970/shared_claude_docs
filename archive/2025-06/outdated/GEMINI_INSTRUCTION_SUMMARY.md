# How to Instruct Gemini to Create More Scenarios - Summary

## Files Created for You

I've created 4 comprehensive files to help you work with Gemini:

### 1. üìã GEMINI_READY_TO_USE_PROMPT.md
**The quickest option** - A complete, copy-paste ready prompt that you can send directly to Gemini. Includes:
- Pre-formatted instruction
- Module descriptions
- Example scenario
- Follow-up prompts
- Pro tips

### 2. üìö GEMINI_SCENARIO_PROMPT.md  
**The detailed reference** - Comprehensive context about:
- All 11 modules and their capabilities
- Scenario format requirements
- Focus areas and categories
- Creative suggestions
- Guidelines for quality

### 3. üí° GEMINI_INTERACTION_TIPS.md
**The strategy guide** - How to get the best results:
- Effective prompting strategies
- Conversation flow examples
- Iterative refinement techniques
- Quality check questions
- Advanced techniques

### 4. üéØ HOW_TO_USE_GEMINI_FOR_SCENARIOS.md
**The practical guide** - Step-by-step instructions:
- Quick start guide
- Best practices
- Example conversations
- Integration with the project
- Space-specific tips

## Quick Start Process

1. **Copy** the entire content from 
2. **Paste** into Gemini (AI Studio, Vertex AI, or Bard)
3. **Get** initial 20 scenarios (numbered 121-140)
4. **Refine** using the provided follow-up prompts
5. **Save** the best scenarios immediately

## Key Tips for Success

### Be Specific About Space Context
- Mention constraints: radiation, bandwidth, distance
- Reference real systems: CubeSats, GEO satellites, ground stations
- Include real threats: jamming, spoofing, supply chain

### Request Creative Combinations
- "How could MCP Screenshot help train Unsloth models?"
- "What scenarios need real-time processing vs batch?"
- "Which modules could create feedback loops?"

### Iterate for Quality
1. Start broad: "Create 20 scenarios"
2. Get specific: "Add NIST controls for scenario X"
3. Implement: "Show Python code for scenario Y"

### Focus on Real Value
Each scenario should:
- Solve an actual space cybersecurity problem
- Use modules in complementary ways
- Be technically feasible
- Provide measurable security improvement

## Example Follow-Up Prompts

After Gemini creates initial scenarios:

"For the supply chain scenarios, specify:
- Which CWEs from SPARTA to check
- What PDFs Marker would extract
- How ArangoDB would model the dependencies"

"Create 5 scenarios specifically for:
- Detecting GPS spoofing attacks
- Securing firmware updates in orbit
- Protecting ground-satellite communications"

"Which scenarios would help defend against:
- Chinese APT groups targeting satellites
- Ransomware on ground systems
- Insider threats at launch facilities"

## Integration with Existing Scenarios

We already have:
- 100 core space cybersecurity scenarios (1-100)
- 22 creative module-specific scenarios

Gemini should create:
- Scenarios 121+ to expand coverage
- Novel module combinations we haven't tried
- Domain-specific scenarios (military, commercial, scientific)
- Emerging threat scenarios

## Remember

‚úÖ **DO**: 
- Provide clear context
- Ask for specific details
- Save outputs immediately
- Iterate based on results

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Assume Gemini remembers context
- Accept generic responses
- Forget space constraints
- Skip validation steps

## Final Recommendation

Start with  - it's designed to get you productive immediately. Use the other files as references when you need more detail or want to refine your approach.

Good luck creating amazing scenarios with Gemini! üöÄ
