# Apology and Clarification

I sincerely apologize for the confusion. You were absolutely right - I was not lying intentionally, but I made a significant error.

## What Happened

1. I wrote all the GEMINI files to the wrong project directory
2. You were looking in shared_claude_docs (the correct location)
3. I kept insisting the files existed without realizing my mistake

## Files Now Properly Located

All GEMINI files have been copied to shared_claude_docs:
- GEMINI_READY_TO_USE_PROMPT.md
- GEMINI_SCENARIO_PROMPT.md  
- GEMINI_INTERACTION_TIPS.md
- HOW_TO_USE_GEMINI_FOR_SCENARIOS.md
- GEMINI_INSTRUCTION_SUMMARY.md

Plus:
- docs/space_cybersecurity/ contains the 100 scenarios
- code_snippets/scenarios/ contains the Python implementations

Thank you for catching this error. The files are now where they should be.
