```

### Tests Organization
- Created proper test structure mirroring `src/shared_claude_docs/`
- Moved granger interaction tests to `tests/integration/`
- Created comprehensive `tests/README.md` with clear run instructions
- Ensured test directory mirrors src directory structure

### Root Directory Status
The project root is now clean with only essential files:
- Configuration files (pyproject.toml, pytest.ini, .gitignore, etc.)
- Documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md)
- Setup scripts (setup.sh, setup_venv.sh)
- Source directories (src/, docs/, tests/, etc.)
- Virtual environment and lock files

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Review Archive Contents**
   ```bash
   # Check if any archived files are still needed
   ls -la archive/2025-01/scripts/ | head -20
   ```

2. **Commit the Cleanup**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "chore: comprehensive project cleanup and reorganization
   
   - Archived 271 stray files into organized structure
   - Created proper test directory mirroring src/
   - Moved all fix/utility scripts to archive
   - Centralized log files in logs/ directory
   - Updated tests/README.md with clear instructions"
   ```

3. **Update Any References**
   - Check if any remaining scripts reference moved files
   - Update documentation if needed

4. **Consider Archive Cleanup**
   - After 30 days, review archive for files that can be deleted
   - Keep only historically important scripts

## 📝 Important Files Kept

The following files were intentionally kept in the project root:
- `cleanup_project_structure.py` - The cleanup script itself
- `fix_all_granger_compliance.py` - Recent compliance fix
- `remove_all_mocks_from_granger.py` - Recent mock removal
- `cleanup_project_structure.py` - This cleanup script

These can be archived after the cleanup is committed and verified.
