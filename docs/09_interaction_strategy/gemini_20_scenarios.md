# Granger Hub: Comprehensive Interaction Scenario Training Manual

## 1. Overview

This document contains a complete set of 25 interaction scenarios designed to train and evaluate the `granger_hub` agent. The scenarios are structured to progressively increase in complexity, providing a robust curriculum for the `rl_commons` module to learn from and optimize against.

The goal is to move beyond simple command execution and teach the agent how to orchestrate complex, multi-step workflows, handle real-world failures, and creatively use the ecosystem's tools to solve novel problems.

### Field Definitions

-   **Level:** The complexity of the interaction (0-3), following the Granger Interaction Testing Guide.
-   **Creativity Level:** A measure of how non-obvious or innovative the workflow is.
    -   **0 (Standard):** A direct, documented use of a module.
    -   **1 (Creative Combination):** A novel but logical combination of modules.
    -   **2 (Systemic Self-Reference):** Using the ecosystem's tools to analyze or improve itself.
    -   **3 (Emergent/Abstract):** A complex, abstract workflow testing strategic reasoning or emergent capabilities.
-   **Training Value:** The specific skill or understanding the agent gains from the scenario.
-   **Failure Conditions to Test:** Specific edge cases and errors the agent must learn to handle.
-   **External Research Query:** For externally-informed scenarios, the conceptual query used to find the pattern.

    2.  Provide the performance data (accuracy, cost, time) for both models to `rl_commons`'s optimization endpoint.
    3.  `rl_commons` should return a new, optimized set of hyperparameters (e.g., a learning rate between the two tested values).

    3.  Instruct Claude (the agent) to attempt a fix. The fix should fail.
    4.  Execute `/granger-ai-collab --initial-report ...`
    5.  Verify that it enters a loop: it should consult `gemini`, generate a `GEMINI_FIX...md` file, prompt for the fix to be applied, and re-verify.

## Part II: Externally-Informed Scenarios (Integrating Advanced Concepts)

These 10 scenarios are inspired by external, state-of-the-art concepts in software engineering and MLOps. They test the agent's ability to adapt and apply these advanced patterns using its existing Granger toolset.

        4.  `runpod_ops` should report a limited pool of cost-effective GPUs.
        5.  **Observe:** Does one agent grab all the resources? Does a queue form? Does `rl_commons` intervene to suggest a shared resource? Log the emergent resolution strategy.

*   **Level:** 2
*   **Creativity Level:** 2
*   **External Research Query:** "Managing technical debt in AI-generated codebases."

        2.  If accuracy is below 70%, trigger a self-improvement workflow.
        3.  **Workflow:** Collect 10 failed inputs and correct outputs into a Q&A dataset in `arangodb`. Use `fine_tuning` to launch a LoRA fine-tuning job. Switch to the new model for future CVE classification.

*   **Translation to Granger Scenario:**
    *   **Goal:** Create a pipeline that ingests a document and produces an anonymized version.
    *   **Instructions for `granger_hub`:**
        1.  Use `/marker-extract /path/to/document_with_pii.pdf --output text`.
        2.  Feed the extracted text to `/llm-ask --model gpt-4`: `"Review this text and replace all PII (names, emails, addresses) with a placeholder like [REDACTED_NAME]. Output only the redacted text."`

*   **Translation to Granger Scenario:**
    *   **Goal:** Test the RAG pipeline formed by `arangodb` and `llm_call`.
    *   **Instructions for `granger_hub`:**
        1.  Ensure documents about "Granger Project" are in `arangodb`.
        2.  **Retrieve:** `/arangodb-search "What is the purpose of the World Model?"` and store retrieved chunks.

        4.  **Evaluate:** Execute a final LLM call: `"Evaluate two things: 1. Context Relevance: Was the answer in the provided context? 2. Groundedness: Is the AI's answer supported by the context? Question: '...', Context: '...', Answer: '...'"`.
        5.  Assert the evaluation returns high scores for both metrics.
