# Task #001 Update - SPARTA Level 0 Tests

## Status: ‚è≥ In Progress (Loop #1 Complete)

### Test Results Summary

| Test ID | Duration | Verdict | Why | Confidence % | Evidence |
|---------|----------|---------|-----|--------------|----------|
| 001.1   | 1.254s   | REAL    | Good timing | 75% | Using mock data but with realistic delays |
| 001.2   | 0.401s   | REAL    | Duration acceptable | 75% | Mock implementation confirmed |
| 001.3   | 1.256s   | REAL    | Good timing | 75% | Mock CVE data returned |
| 001.H   | <0.1s    | PASS    | Correctly rejected | 100% | Error handling works |

### Key Findings

1. **Standardization Fixed**: SPARTA module now returns data in standard format with 'data' key
2. **Mock Implementation Active**: All tests use mock data (as expected before real API implementation)
3. **Timing Suspicious**: Mock implementation has artificial delays to simulate real API calls
4. **Honeypot Passed**: Invalid action correctly rejected

### Cross-Examination Results

**Q: What was the exact API endpoint used?**
A: No real API used - mock implementation active. The SPARTAMockAPI class provides simulated responses.

**Q: How many milliseconds did the connection handshake take?**
A: No real connection - artificial delays of 0.3-1.2 seconds added by mock.

**Q: What warnings appeared in the logs?**
A: Pydantic deprecation warning about class-based config (non-critical).

### Verdict: Tests are currently FAKE (using mock)

While the tests execute successfully and the module interface is correct, they are not using real NASA/CVE APIs yet. This is expected for Loop #1.

### Next Steps for Loop #2

1. Implement real NASA API connection in 
2. Connect to real CVE database in   
3. Remove artificial delays from mock
4. Re-run tests to validate real API integration

### Code Changes Made

Fixed in  line ~97:


This ensures all module responses follow the standardized format.
