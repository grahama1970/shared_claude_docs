# Docs Reorganization Summary - January 2025

## Current Situation

The `/docs/` directory has accumulated various files over the past months, with some dating back to June 2025. The structure needs reorganization to follow the natural Granger development workflow.

## Key Findings

### 1. Outdated Files Identified
- **June 2025 artifacts**: DAILY_STANDUP_2025_06_04.md, UI_UNIFICATION_PROGRESS.md
- **Completed reports**: Multiple PHASE2 completion reports in tasks/
- **Individual test reports**: Over 30 individual test reports that should be consolidated
- **Duplicate indexes**: 3 versions of INDEX files in 02_modules/

### 2. Proposed New Structure
Following the workflow: Research → Strategy → Planning → Implementation → Validation → Operations

```
docs/
├── 00_research/      # Transcripts, papers
├── 01_strategy/      # Ideas, architecture, whitepaper  
├── 02_planning/      # Task lists (active/completed)
├── 03_modules/       # Module documentation
├── 04_implementation/# Guides and patterns
├── 05_validation/    # Test plans and reports
├── 06_operations/    # Current state and monitoring
└── archive/          # Historical documents
```

## Created Documents

1. **REORGANIZATION_PLAN_2025.md** - Detailed migration plan
2. **FILES_TO_ARCHIVE.md** - Specific files to move to archive
3. **DOCS_REORGANIZATION_TASKS_2025.md** - Task list following TASK_LIST_TEMPLATE_GUIDE_V2
4. **000_INDEX_NEW.md** - New navigation index for reorganized structure

## Benefits of Reorganization

1. **Clear Workflow**: Documentation follows development progression
2. **Easy Discovery**: Numbered directories show natural flow
3. **Clean Separation**: Active vs archived content
4. **Reduced Clutter**: ~40+ files moved to archive
5. **Better Navigation**: Clear index and structure

## Immediate Actions Needed

### Phase 1: Archive (Today)
```bash
# Create archive structure
mkdir -p docs/archive/2025-01/{reports,tasks,planning}

# Archive June 2025 files
git mv docs/DAILY_STANDUP_2025_06_04.md docs/archive/2025-06/
git mv docs/UI_UNIFICATION_PROGRESS.md docs/archive/2025-06/

# Archive duplicate indexes
git mv docs/02_modules/000_INDEX_UPDATED.md.backup docs/archive/2025-01/
```

### Phase 2: Create Structure (This Week)
- Run Task #002 from DOCS_REORGANIZATION_TASKS_2025.md
- Create new directory structure
- Add README files to each section

### Phase 3: Migrate Content (Next Week)
- Run Tasks #003-005 from task list
- Move content to new locations
- Update all references

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Use git mv** to preserve history
2. **Create backup** before major moves
3. **Update references** after each move
4. **Verify links** with automated checker
5. **No deletion** - only archival

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Zero broken internal links
- [ ] All files accessible in logical locations
- [ ] Git history preserved for all moves
- [ ] Clear distinction between active/archived
- [ ] Updated CLAUDE.md and README.md

## Conclusion

This reorganization will transform the docs from a historical accumulation into a living workflow-based system that supports the Granger development process. The numbered structure (00-06) provides intuitive navigation from research through operations.
