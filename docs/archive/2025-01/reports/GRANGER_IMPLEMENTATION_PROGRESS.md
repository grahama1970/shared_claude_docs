## Remaining Priority Tasks (145/150)

### High Priority - Core Infrastructure (Tasks #006-#015)
- Task #006: Marker - AI-Enhanced Accuracy Improvements
- Task #007: SPARTA - Cybersecurity Resource Enrichment
- Task #008: Claude Max Proxy - Multi-Model Orchestration
- Task #009: Unsloth - Student-Teacher Learning
- Task #010: Test Reporter - Flaky Test Detection
- Task #011-#015: Level 1 & 2 Interactions

### Medium Priority - Advanced Features (Tasks #016-#050)
- Visualization Intelligence
- Hardware Telemetry Integration
- Compliance Framework Mapping
- Contradiction Detection
- Progressive Deployment

### Implementation Strategy

Given the large number of remaining tasks, I recommend:

1. **Continue Core Module Tests** (Tasks #005-#010)
   - Complete individual module capabilities
   - Establish baseline functionality

2. **Implement Key Interactions** (Tasks #011-#015)
   - Level 1: Two-module pipelines
   - Level 2: Multi-source aggregation
   - Level 3: Full orchestration

3. **Add Critical Features** (Tasks #016-#025)
   - Visualization intelligence
   - Hardware integration
   - Compliance mapping

4. **Scale Testing** (Tasks #026-#150)
   - Performance optimization
   - Security hardening
   - Documentation updates

## Test Framework Standards

All completed tasks follow GRANGER standards:
- Real API/system usage (no mocks)
- Realistic timing constraints
- Honeypot tests to catch fake implementations
- Comprehensive evaluation with confidence scores
- JSON report generation
- Cross-examination of results

## Next Immediate Actions

1. Complete Task #005: ArangoDB Graph Self-Organization
2. Implement Task #006: Marker AI Enhancement
3. Continue through priority task list

## Resource Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- All module dependencies installed
- API keys for external services (YouTube, etc.)
- ArangoDB instance running
- Sufficient compute for ML tasks

## Questions for Clarification

Before proceeding with all 150 tasks:

1. Should I continue implementing all tasks sequentially?
2. Are there specific high-priority tasks to focus on?
3. Should I create more condensed implementations for similar tasks?
4. Do you need full test suites for every single task?

The current pace would result in extremely long implementation files. Would you prefer:
- A. Continue with full implementations for all 150 tasks
- B. Focus on key tasks with condensed implementations for others
- C. Create a framework that can be extended for remaining tasks
- D. Stop at a certain number of completed tasks

Please advise on the preferred approach for the remaining 145 tasks.
