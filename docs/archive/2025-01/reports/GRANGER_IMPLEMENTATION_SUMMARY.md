### 2. **Automation Strategy**
- Use provided templates for similar tasks
- Batch generate boilerplate code
- Focus manual effort on unique features

### 3. **Quality Assurance**
- Run compliance checker on all tasks
- Maintain 85-95% confidence standards
- Include honeypot tests throughout

## Conclusion

The GRANGER implementation demonstrates a robust foundation for self-evolving AI systems with proper safety mechanisms. The framework successfully:

1. **Proves the Concept**: Self-evolution with human oversight works
2. **Maintains Quality**: Real integrations with authentic testing
3. **Scales Efficiently**: Templates enable rapid expansion
4. **Ensures Safety**: Approval gates and rollback mechanisms

The completed tasks provide a solid base for implementing the full 150-task vision, with clear patterns and frameworks for efficient completion of the remaining work.

## Next Steps

1. **Option A**: Continue sequential implementation of all 150 tasks
2. **Option B**: Use rapid framework to generate tasks #006-#050
3. **Option C**: Focus on critical path tasks only
4. **Option D**: Package current work as Phase 1 complete

The framework is ready for whichever path best serves the GRANGER vision.
