# Everyday Interaction Scenarios - Overview

## Purpose

These scenarios represent **real, practical tasks** that users perform daily with the Claude Module Communicator - not complex orchestrations, but simple, useful interactions.

## Three Complexity Levels

### Level 1: Simple (1-2 modules, < 5 minutes)
- Single-purpose tasks
- Direct module calls
- Immediate results
- No complex logic

**Examples**:
- "Get me recent papers on X"
- "Take a screenshot of this"
- "Save this to memory"
- "Extract tables from PDF"

### Level 2: Moderate (2-4 modules, 5-15 minutes)
- Multi-step workflows
- Some data transformation
- Basic decision logic
- Combining outputs

**Examples**:
- "Find what Expert X says and show code examples"
- "Screenshot a table and create Q&A pairs"
- "Check code from PDF for vulnerabilities"
- "Build a simple knowledge graph"

### Level 3: Complex (4-7 modules, 15-60 minutes)
- Full pipelines
- Multiple decision points
- Data synthesis
- Iterative processing

**Examples**:
- "Research topic, find implementations, build knowledge base"
- "Complete security audit with report"
- "Build learning curriculum from multiple sources"
- "Track knowledge evolution over time"

## Key Differences from Space Cybersecurity Scenarios

### Everyday Scenarios:
- **User-driven**: "I need to..."
- **Task-focused**: Specific outcomes
- **Time-sensitive**: Minutes not hours
- **Interactive**: User in the loop
- **Practical**: Common use cases

### Space Cybersecurity Scenarios:
- **System-driven**: Automated workflows
- **Security-focused**: Threat detection
- **Comprehensive**: Full coverage
- **Autonomous**: Minimal interaction
- **Specialized**: Domain-specific

## Module Usage Patterns

### Most Common Combinations:

**Research Tasks**:
- ArXiv → LLM Call (paper analysis)
- YouTube → Marker (tutorial to docs)
- ArXiv → YouTube → ArangoDB (complete research)

**Documentation Tasks**:
- MCP Screenshot → Marker (visual docs)
- Marker → LLM Call (content generation)
- Marker → SPARTA (compliance check)

**Memory Tasks**:
- Chat → ArangoDB (save conversation)
- ArangoDB → ArXiv (context-aware search)
- ArangoDB → LLM Call (memory-augmented response)

**Development Tasks**:
- YouTube → LLM Call (learn and implement)
- SPARTA → Test Reporter (security check)
- Marker → Unsloth (document to training)

## Quick Reference

### By Task Type:

**"I need to find..."**
- Level 1: #1, #2, #9, #10, #14
- Level 2: #1, #3, #4, #14
- Level 3: #1, #6, #11

**"I need to extract..."**
- Level 1: #4, #12, #19
- Level 2: #6, #16, #19
- Level 3: #1, #2, #8

**"I need to remember..."**
- Level 1: #5, #6, #13
- Level 2: #4, #7, #10
- Level 3: #8, #14, #15

**"I need to check..."**
- Level 1: #7, #14
- Level 2: #6, #9, #11
- Level 3: #2, #4, #9

**"I need to create..."**
- Level 1: #8, #15
- Level 2: #2, #10, #13
- Level 3: #3, #5, #10

## Implementation Guide

### For Developers:

1. **Start with Level 1**: Implement single-module calls
2. **Add coordination**: Build Level 2 multi-module flows
3. **Enable complexity**: Create Level 3 pipelines
4. **Focus on speed**: Users want quick results
5. **Provide feedback**: Show progress for longer tasks

### For Users:

1. **Be specific**: "Extract tables from page 5" not "process document"
2. **Start simple**: Use Level 1 for quick tasks
3. **Build up**: Combine Level 1 tasks into Level 2 workflows
4. **Save patterns**: Store successful workflows in ArangoDB
5. **Iterate**: Refine based on results

## Common Patterns

### Information Gathering


### Validation


### Learning


### Memory Building


## Success Metrics

### Level 1 Success:
- Response in < 1 minute
- Single, clear output
- No user confusion
- Direct value

### Level 2 Success:
- Complete in < 10 minutes
- Clear step progression
- Useful combined output
- Some automation

### Level 3 Success:
- Finish in < 1 hour
- Comprehensive results
- New insights generated
- Reusable workflow

## Future Enhancements

1. **Natural Language**: "Just do what I did last week"
2. **Learning**: System learns user patterns
3. **Suggestions**: "You might also want to..."
4. **Shortcuts**: Save and replay workflows
5. **Collaboration**: Share scenarios with team

## Getting Started

Pick a Level 1 scenario that matches your immediate need:
- Need papers? Try #1 or #10
- Need to remember? Try #5 or #6  
- Need to extract? Try #4 or #12
- Need to check? Try #7 or #14

Then build up to more complex workflows as needed!
