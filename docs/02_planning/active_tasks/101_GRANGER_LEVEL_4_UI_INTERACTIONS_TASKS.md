## 📜 Definitions and Rules
- **REAL Test**: A test that interacts with live UI systems through Playwright/Puppeteer, validates against 2025 Style Guide compliance, and meets minimum performance criteria (e.g., interaction latency < 300ms, animation @ 60fps).  
- **FAKE Test**: A test using mocks, stubs, or headless mode without visual validation, or failing performance/style compliance.  
- **Confidence Threshold**: Tests with <90% confidence are automatically marked FAKE.
- **Level 4 Criteria**: 
  - Full end-to-end user workflows across multiple UI modules
  - Real browser automation with screenshot validation
  - Style guide compliance verification (colors, spacing, animations)
  - RL Commons integration for adaptive UI behavior
  - Cross-module context preservation
- **Status Indicators**:  
  - ✅ Complete: All tests passed as REAL, verified in final loop.  
  - ⏳ In Progress: Actively running test loops.  
  - 🚫 Blocked: Waiting for dependencies (listed).  
  - 🔄 Not Started: No tests run yet.  
- **Validation Rules**:  
  - All UI interactions must comply with 2025_STYLE_GUIDE.md specifications
  - Visual regression tests must pass with >95% similarity
  - Animations must maintain 60fps during transitions
  - Cross-module workflows must preserve full context
  - RL-driven adaptations must show measurable improvement
  - Maximum 3 test loops per task; escalate failures to graham@granger.com  
- **Environment Setup**:  
  - Python 3.9+, Node.js 18+, pnpm 8+  
  - Playwright 1.40+ with headed browser mode
  - All UI modules running: annotator, chat, terminal
  - RL Commons v1.0+ with UI adaptation models

## 🎯 TASK #001: Playwright Test Infrastructure for UI Validation

**Status**: 🔄 Not Started  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Expected Test Duration**: 2.0s–5.0s per test  

### Implementation
- [ ] Set up Playwright test framework with visual regression capabilities
- [ ] Create page object models for all three UI modules (annotator, chat, terminal)
- [ ] Implement screenshot comparison with style guide validation
- [ ] Create performance monitoring utilities (FPS, latency, memory)
- [ ] Set up test data fixtures for realistic user scenarios

### Test Loop
```
CURRENT LOOP: #1
1. RUN tests → Generate JSON/HTML reports with screenshots.
2. EVALUATE tests: Mark as REAL or FAKE based on visual validation and performance.
3. VALIDATE authenticity and confidence:
   - Query LLM: "For test [Test ID], rate your confidence (0-100%) that this test used real browser automation with visual validation. List any headless or mocked components."
   - IF confidence < 90% → Mark test as FAKE
   - IF confidence ≥ 90% → Proceed to visual inspection
4. VISUAL INSPECTION:
   - "Do the screenshots show real rendered UI components?"
   - "Are the style guide colors (#4F46E5, #6366F1) visible?"
   - "Is the 8px spacing grid maintained?"
   - Inconsistent answers → Mark as FAKE
5. IF any FAKE → Apply fixes → Increment loop (max 3).
6. IF loop fails 3 times → Escalate with full screenshot analysis.
```
