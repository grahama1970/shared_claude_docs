# Audit Report Template Example

This is an example of how the `/audit` command generates reports:

## Example Individual Project Report
**Generated by:** `/audit /home/graham/workspace/experiments/marker`

```markdown
# Project Audit: marker
**Date:** 2025-06-04 14:30:15
**Path:** /home/graham/workspace/experiments/marker

## Executive Summary
- **Overall Status:** üü° Needs Attention
- **README Accuracy:** Mostly Accurate
- **Implementation Completeness:** 75% of claimed features implemented

## README Claims Analysis

### ‚ùå Unimplemented Claims
1. **Feature:** "Batch processing with progress tracking"
   - **Status:** Not implemented
   - **Evidence:** No batch module found in src/
   - **Priority:** Medium

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented Claims
1. **Feature:** "Table extraction with merged cell support"
   - **Status:** Basic tables only, no merged cells
   - **Location:** src/marker/tables/extractor.py:45
   - **Missing:** Merged cell detection and handling

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented Claims
1. **Feature:** "PDF text extraction"
   - **Status:** Fully implemented and working
   - **Location:** src/marker/extraction/text.py
   - **Quality:** Good, with proper error handling

## Undocumented Features

### Missing from README
1. **Feature:** Schema validation utilities
   - **Location:** src/marker/schema/validator.py
   - **Usage:** Used internally but not documented
   - **Action:** Add usage examples to README

## Recommendations

### High Priority
- [ ] Implement merged cell support for tables
- [ ] Add batch processing documentation

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Document schema validation features
- [ ] Add missing API examples

### Low Priority
- [ ] Improve error messages
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
```

## Example Master State Report
**Generated by:** `/audit --all`

File: `0604_Current_State_Granger_Ecosystem.md`

```markdown
# Granger Ecosystem State Report
**Generated:** 2025-06-04 14:45:30
**Report Type:** Comprehensive Multi-Project Audit

## Executive Dashboard

### Project Health Overview
| Project | Status | README Accuracy | Implementation % | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| marker | üü° Needs Attention | Mostly Accurate | 75% | Medium |
| arangodb | üü¢ Healthy | Accurate | 90% | Low |
| sparta | üî¥ Critical | Outdated | 45% | High |
| claude-module-communicator | üü¢ Healthy | Accurate | 85% | Low |

### Summary Statistics
- **Total Projects Audited:** 17
- **Healthy Projects:** 8
- **Projects Needing Attention:** 6
- **Critical Issues:** 3
- **Average Implementation Rate:** 73%

## Cross-Project Issues

### Common Problems
1. **Outdated README files** - Found in 5 projects
2. **Missing test documentation** - Found in 8 projects
3. **Incomplete MCP configurations** - Found in 3 projects

### Ecosystem-Wide Recommendations
1. **Immediate:** Fix critical projects (sparta, youtube_transcripts, fine_tuning)
2. **This Month:** Align all READMEs with actual implementation
3. **Next Quarter:** Implement missing claimed features across ecosystem
```

## Usage Examples

To generate these reports:

```bash
# Audit single project
/audit /home/graham/workspace/experiments/marker

# Audit all projects and generate master report
/audit --all

# Just analyze state without detailed audit
/state --summary-only
```

The reports help track:
- Which projects need immediate attention
- What features are promised but not delivered
- What features exist but aren't documented
- Overall ecosystem health trends over time
