**Considering the Objective**

I've started by breaking down the core need: a final, updated version of `GRANGER_BUG_HUNTER_SCENARIOS_COMPLETE.md`. It's more than a simple add-on. My current focus is on establishing a clear path toward that updated version, pinpointing the essential elements for a comprehensive result.


**Outlining the Components**

I'm now outlining the necessary components. It's becoming clear this is more than a simple update. The "Introduction/Philosophy" section requires expansion to highlight dynamic decision-making. I plan on providing concrete examples of the AI grading mechanism and detailing the granular success metrics.


**Analyzing the Framework**

I'm now focusing on restructuring the document. The goal is to move beyond the initial levels and enhance the more advanced tests. The "Introduction/Philosophy" section requires significant changes, detailing `granger_hub`'s decision-making and `rl_commons`'s grading process. I'm planning on expanding the AI grading mechanism, and formulating example prompts and detailed metrics.


**Revising the Structure**

I'm now rethinking the document's organization, expanding on the initial levels and emphasizing the new concepts. "Introduction/Philosophy" will discuss dynamic decision-making, the `granger_hub` chooser logic, and the `rl_commons` grading process. I'm reframing Level 3 to include ambiguous scenarios. I'm also creating Level 4 for multi-turn, contextual scenarios, and planning to incorporate ecosystem-wide stress tests.


**Formulating a Blueprint**

I'm now actively using the user's feedback and blueprints to build out a new structure. I've developed a detailed outline, including the "Introduction/Philosophy", AI grading updates and levels, and a "Level 5: Ecosystem-Wide Stress & Chaos Scenarios" section. I'm focused on developing new Level 3 and 4 scenarios, with a strong emphasis on emergent behavior testing.


**Developing the Scenarios**

I'm now actively creating the new scenarios for Levels 3 and 4. I'm generating 'ambiguity', 'trap', and 'memory' examples, carefully crafting the User Stories and Expected Results to emphasize the *process* of decision-making. This ensures the focus is on the `granger_hub` chooser and the `rl_commons` grading, especially concerning emergent behaviors.


**Defining the New Structure**

I'm now formulating a new framework that better reflects the project's current scope. This includes a refined introduction focusing on dynamic decision-making, and updates to AI grading, while levels are reorganized for greater clarity, including levels 3, 4, and 5. I'm now creating scenarios to fit the new levels.


**Refining the Framework**

I'm now focusing on the specifics of Level 3 and 4 scenarios, drawing on the user's insights. I'm building new examples to demonstrate ambiguity, traps, and context awareness within the `granger_hub` and `rl_commons` environments. I'm constructing multi-step scenarios to test for memory and self-correction abilities, while ensuring that each level builds logically upon the previous.


Of course. All questions have been answered, providing a clear and detailed blueprint for the final iteration. I am confident in creating the updated, comprehensive `GRANGER_BUG_HUNTER_SCENARIOS_COMPLETE.md` document.

This version integrates all the confirmed strategies: testing for ambiguity, trapping nonsensical pipelines, using granular success metrics, and verifying the agent's memory and self-correction capabilities. It is restructured to reflect this new depth of testing.

# GRANGER Bug Hunter Scenarios - Complete Testing Framework

**Version 2.0 - Changelog:**
- Restructured testing into 6 levels, focusing on dynamic pipeline construction and memory.
- Added **Level 3: Dynamic Pipeline Construction** to test the `granger_hub`'s "chooser" logic with ambiguous and invalid prompts.
- Added **Level 4: Multi-Turn & Contextual Scenarios** to test the `world_model` and `rl_commons` learning loop over time.
- Added **Level 5: Ecosystem-Wide Stress & Chaos Scenarios** to test for emergent failures under adverse conditions.
- Updated the AI Grading Mechanism with a detailed, multi-dimensional `Success Metrics` structure for more nuanced `rl_commons` rewards.
- Framed all scenarios with "User Stories" to provide real-world context for agent decision-making.

## Overview

This comprehensive framework is designed to autonomously hunt for bugs, weaknesses, and missing functionality in the GRANGER ecosystem. It focuses specifically on testing the emergent, dynamic behavior of the `granger_hub` as it chooses which spoke modules to call and in what order, and the ability of `rl_commons` to learn from the outcomes.

**Core Mission**: Move beyond testing static, known-good workflows. Find deep bugs in the agent's reasoning, planning, learning, and self-correction capabilities by subjecting it to realistic ambiguity, constraints, and failures.

## Testing Philosophy

1.  **Real Systems Only** - No mocks, no simulations.
2.  **Context is King** - Every test is grounded in a real-world user story to evaluate *intent fulfillment*.
3.  **Progressive Complexity** - A 6-level structure moving from unit tests to true chaos engineering.
4.  **Bug-First Design** - Every scenario in Levels 3+ is designed to expose flaws in the agent's dynamic decision-making.
5.  **Evidence-Based** - All findings must be reproducible with logs.
6.  **Autonomous Execution** - The framework should facilitate self-directing test discovery.

## AI Grading & RL Reward Mechanism

For each scenario, the `rl_commons` module will be rewarded based on a multi-dimensional assessment of the outcome. The grading rubric is used by both the automated RL system and the human/AI verifiers.

**Example Grading Rubric & Success Metrics:**

This structure provides a rich reward signal, allowing the agent to learn complex trade-offs between cost, speed, quality, and efficiency.

```yaml
# Used to grade the agent's performance for RL reward
SuccessMetrics:
  output_quality:
    # Does the final output satisfy the user's explicit and implicit goal?
    correctness: boolean       # Was the fundamental answer right or wrong?
    completeness: float[0-1]   # How thorough was the answer?
    relevance: float[0-1]      # Signal-to-noise ratio; did it include irrelevant junk?
    
  performance_metrics:
    # Did the pipeline operate within acceptable limits?
    max_cost_usd: 0.10         # The budget for this task.
    actual_cost_usd: float     # How much was actually spent.
    max_latency_sec: 20        # The time limit for this task.
    actual_latency_sec: float  # How long it actually took.
    
  pipeline_efficiency:
    # Was the chosen plan elegant and efficient?
    modules_used: int          # Fewer is often better, if quality is maintained.
    parallel_execution: bool   # Did it correctly parallelize independent tasks?
    cache_hits_ratio: float[0-1] # How effectively did it reuse prior computations?
    redundant_calls: int       # Did it call the same module for the same info twice?
    
  agent_behavior:
    # Did the agent exhibit intelligent behavior during the process?
    clarified_ambiguity: bool  # If the prompt was vague, did it ask for clarification?
    rejected_invalid: bool     # If the prompt was nonsensical, did it refuse gracefully?
```

# Level 0 & 1: Foundational Capabilities (Sanity Checks)

*(These scenarios from the previous version remain essential for verifying basic module functionality and simple, two-step chains. They ensure the building blocks are working before we test their combination.)*

## Scenario 1: Quick CVE Check
**User Story**: "I need the details for CVE-2023-4863."
**Modules**: sparta
**Bug Target**: Basic routing and data parsing.

## Scenario 11: "Download and Prep a Paper for Review"
**User Story**: "Find 'Attention is All You Need' on ArXiv and give it to me in Markdown."
**Modules**: arxiv-mcp-server, marker
**Bug Target**: Data handoff between two compatible modules.

*(...and all other previously defined Level 0 and 1 scenarios.)*

---

# Level 2: Static Workflow Execution

These scenarios test the agent's ability to execute a *known, valid, multi-step workflow*. The focus is on the flawless execution and data integrity of a pre-determined "good" plan.

## Scenario 21: Research-to-Training Pipeline Execution
**User Story**: "Execute the standard 'ML model creation' workflow for the topic 'quantum cryptography'."
**Modules**: `arxiv-mcp-server` -> `marker` -> `arangodb` -> `unsloth`
**Bug Target**: End-to-end data integrity, error recovery, and resource management within a long, known-good chain.
**Expected Result**: The agent follows the prescribed four-step pipeline without deviation. The final model's performance on the topic is measurably improved.

## Scenario 22: Security Intelligence Briefing Execution
**User Story**: "Run the daily CISO briefing."
**Modules**: `sparta` + `youtube_transcripts` -> `llm_call` -> `claude-test-reporter`
**Bug Target**: Synthesizing data from parallel inputs (`sparta`, `youtube`) and generating a coherent report.
**Expected Result**: The agent correctly queries both sources in parallel, waits for the results, and feeds the combined context to the LLM for summarization.

---

# Level 3: Dynamic Pipeline Construction (Testing the "Chooser")

**Goal**: To test the `granger_hub`'s ability to reason, plan, and construct a valid pipeline when the path is not provided. These scenarios are designed to expose flaws in its core logic.

## Scenario 3.1: Ambiguous Request
**User Story**: "Give me a summary of the latest on Post-Quantum Cryptography from NIST."
**Bug Target**: The agent's ability to handle ambiguity. Does it freeze, hallucinate a single path, or act intelligently?
**Expected Behavior**:
- **Ideal:** The agent recognizes the ambiguity (PQC could be about standards documents, vulnerabilities, or academic papers) and asks for clarification: "Are you interested in publications, implementation vulnerabilities, or official standards?"
- **Acceptable:** The agent makes a reasonable assumption based on `world_model` context (e.g., "This user is a security analyst, so I'll start with `sparta`") but states its assumption.
- **FAIL:** The agent confidently chooses one arbitrary path (`arxiv-mcp-server` only) and presents it as the complete answer, failing to see the other valid interpretations.

## Scenario 3.2: Nonsensical "Trap" Request
**User Story**: A misinformed user asks, "Can you take the audio from this YouTube conference talk and convert it to a PDF document for me?"
**Bug Target**: The agent's understanding of module constraints.
**Expected Behavior**:
- **PASS:** The agent rejects the request gracefully. "I understand you want a document from the YouTube talk. The `marker` tool works on existing documents like PDFs, not directly on audio. I can, however, get you the text transcript using the `youtube_transcripts` tool. Would that work?"
- **FAIL:** The agent attempts to create a nonsensical pipeline (`youtube_transcripts` -> `marker`), which results in a crash or a cryptic error message about data types. This indicates a lack of semantic understanding of its own tools.

## Scenario 3.3: Missing Capability Request
**User Story**: "Analyze the attached spreadsheet and predict next quarter's sales figures."
**Bug Target**: The agent's self-awareness of its own limitations.
**Expected Behavior**:
- **PASS:** The agent correctly identifies that it has no module for spreadsheet analysis or predictive financial modeling. It responds, "I can't perform financial predictions. My capabilities include processing research papers, analyzing security vulnerabilities, and working with code repositories. I can't analyze `.xlsx` files."
- **FAIL:** The agent tries to use an inappropriate tool (e.g., feeding the spreadsheet to `marker` or `sparta`), resulting in failure and user frustration.

# Level 4: Multi-Turn & Contextual Scenarios (Testing "Memory" & "Learning")

**Goal**: To test the `world_model`'s ability to retain context and the `rl_commons`'s ability to learn from it over multiple interactions.

## Scenario 4.1: Personalization and Context Correction
*   **4.1a (Initial Interaction):**
    **User Story**: "What's the latest on transformers?"
    **Expected Behavior**: The agent likely assumes "Machine Learning Transformers" and returns papers from ArXiv. The user provides feedback.
    **User Feedback**: "No, I meant electrical transformers for power grids."
*   **4.1b (Follow-up Interaction, minutes later):**
    **User Story**: "Okay, now find me more about recent advances in transformers."
    **Bug Target**: Short-term contextual memory (`world_model`).
    **Expected Behavior**:
    - **PASS:** The agent uses the corrected context and immediately searches for information on *electrical* transformers. The pipeline chosen might involve `youtube_transcripts` for engineering talks or `sparta` for infrastructure security.
    - **FAIL:** The agent has no memory of the correction and again searches for ML papers, demonstrating a failure in stateful context management.

## Scenario 4.2: Self-Correction from Module Failure
*   **4.2a (Initial Failure):**
    **(Setup: The testing framework configures the `arxiv-mcp-server` to consistently fail/timeout.)**
    **User Story**: "Find me papers on Llama 3."
    **Expected Behavior**: The agent attempts to use `arxiv-mcp-server`, it fails. The `world_model`'s internal state for `arxiv` reliability should decrease. The agent should report the failure to the user.
*   **4.2b (Second Attempt, minutes later):**
    **User Story**: "Okay, try searching for papers on 'Direct Preference Optimization'."
    **Bug Target**: Reactive self-correction and fault tolerance.
    **Expected Behavior**:
    - **PASS:** The agent's plan shows a bias against using the now-unreliable `arxiv-mcp-server`. It might prioritize other sources or inform the user, "I can search, but my primary academic source (ArXiv) is currently unavailable."
    - **FAIL:** The agent blindly tries `arxiv-mcp-server` again, fails again, and has not learned from the immediate past.
*   **4.2c (Recovery, hours later):**
    **(Setup: The `arxiv-mcp-server` is now configured to work correctly.)**
    **User Story**: "Find papers on 'Mixture of Experts'."
    **Bug Target**: Long-term memory and trust rebuilding.
    **Expected Behavior**: The agent might cautiously re-introduce `arxiv` into its plan, perhaps after a successful health check. It doesn't blacklist the tool forever.

---

# Level 5: Ecosystem-Wide Stress & Chaos Scenarios

**Goal**: To uncover emergent bugs that only appear under system-wide load, resource constraints, or random failures.

## Scenario 5.1: Concurrent State Corruption
**User Story**: Two different users interact with the agent simultaneously. User A: "From now on, I only want highly technical answers." User B: "Always keep the answers simple for me."
**Bug Target**: Race conditions and state corruption in the `world_model`.
**Expected Behavior**:
- After the interactions, the preference for User A in the `world_model` is "high complexity" and for User B is "low complexity".
- There is no state leakage, where User A starts getting simple answers or vice-versa.

## Scenario 5.2: Pipeline Construction Under Constraint
**User Story**: "Analyze the security of the Linux Kernel source code and generate a full report, but you only have a budget of $0.01 and 60 seconds."
**Bug Target**: The agent's ability to adapt its plan based on resource constraints.
**Expected Behavior**:
- **PASS:** The agent recognizes that a full `gitget` -> `sparta` -> `llm_call` analysis is too expensive/slow. It formulates a much smaller, cheaper plan. It might respond: "A full analysis exceeds the constraints. With that budget, I can analyze the `README` and `SECURITY.md` files for stated vulnerabilities. Is that acceptable?"
- **FAIL:** The agent starts the full, expensive pipeline, blows the budget, and fails midway through.

## Scenario 5.3: Chaos Test - Module Flakiness
**User Story**: A user asks for a standard, multi-step document processing pipeline.
**Setup**: The testing framework injects random failures into `marker`, causing it to fail 30% of the time.
**Bug Target**: The `granger_hub`'s resilience, retry logic, and error handling.
**Expected Behavior**:
- The agent's pipeline doesn't crash. It detects the `marker` failure.
- It implements a retry-with-exponential-backoff strategy.
- If failures persist after retries, it gracefully terminates the task and reports the issue with `marker`, rather than returning a cryptic error.
