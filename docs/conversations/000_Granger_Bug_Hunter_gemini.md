# GRANGER Bug Hunter Scenarios - Complete Testing Framework

## Overview

This comprehensive framework includes ALL unique scenarios from across the Granger ecosystem, designed to autonomously hunt for bugs, weaknesses, and missing functionality through real module interactions.

**Core Mission**: Find real bugs through creative, systematic testing that pushes modules beyond their comfort zones. Each scenario is framed with a **User Story & Rationale** to provide real-world context, helping the `granger_hub` agent understand the *purpose* of its actions. This is critical for the `rl_commons` module to grade and optimize dynamic pipeline generation based on user intent.

## Testing Philosophy

1.  **Real Systems Only** - No mocks, no simulations (per TEST_VERIFICATION_TEMPLATE_GUIDE)
2.  **Context is King** - Every test is grounded in a real-world user story.
3.  **Progressive Complexity** - Level 0-3 structure with creativity ratings
4.  **Bug-First Design** - Every test designed to expose weaknesses, especially in dynamic inter-module communication.
5.  **Autonomous Execution** - Self-directing test discovery and execution
6.  **Evidence-Based** - All findings must be reproducible with logs
7.  **Multi-AI Verification** - Perplexity and Gemini must grade actual responses against expected outcomes

## AI Grading Mechanism

For each scenario, the testing framework will:
1.  **Execute** the actual test and capture the response
2.  **Compare** the actual response to the expected outcome
3.  **Grade** using both Perplexity and Gemini to verify:
    - Does the actual response fulfill the user's goal described in the rationale?
    - Are there any deviations that indicate bugs in the module chain?
    - Is the module behaving as originally designed?

Example grading prompt:
```
Scenario: [Name]
User Goal: [What the user is trying to achieve]
Expected Result: [What should happen technically]
Actual Response: [What actually happened]
Grade this response: Does it meet the user's goal? What bugs in the agent's chosen pipeline are indicated?
```

# Level 0: Single Module Tests (Fundamental Capabilities)

These scenarios test the core competency of individual spoke modules. The agent must prove it can route a simple, direct request to the correct tool.

## Scenario 1: Quick CVE Check
**User Story & Rationale**: As a cybersecurity analyst, I just saw a CVE ID mentioned in a morning briefing. I need to get the essential details immediately. This tests the agent's ability to handle the most basic, high-frequency security query by correctly invoking the `sparta` module for a fast, structured answer.
**Modules**: sparta
**Bug Target**: CVE data retrieval, parsing, and response speed.
**Expected Result**:
- Should return structured CVE data with fields: ID, description, severity, affected systems
- Response time 1-5 seconds for typical query
- Empty results for non-existent CVEs with clear message
- Handle malformed CVE IDs gracefully

## Scenario 2: Find a Specific Research Paper
**User Story & Rationale**: As a research scientist, a colleague mentioned "that new paper on diffusion models by Chen et al." I need to find it on ArXiv and get the abstract and PDF link without leaving my workflow. This tests if the agent can correctly route a research query to `arxiv-mcp-server` and handle academic search syntax.
**Modules**: `arxiv-mcp-server`
**Bug Target**: Research paper search and metadata extraction.
**Expected Result**:
- Returns list of papers with title, authors, abstract, PDF URL
- Handles special characters in queries (e.g., "MÃ¼ller", "âˆ‡f(x)")
- Pagination works correctly for large result sets
- Empty query returns error, not all papers

## Scenario 3: Store a Finding in the Knowledge Graph
**User Story & Rationale**: As an engineer, I've just discovered a key relationship between two software components. I want to tell the system, "Remember that Component A depends on Library X." This tests the agent's ability to take a piece of information and correctly use `arangodb` to persist it as a node or edge in the graph.
**Modules**: arangodb
**Bug Target**: Graph database CRUD operations.
**Expected Result**:
- Insert returns document ID
- Query returns matching documents or empty array
- Graph traversal respects depth limits
- Handles concurrent operations without data corruption

## Scenario 4: Get Transcript of a Conference Talk
**User Story & Rationale**: As a developer, I missed a key conference talk on YouTube about a new API. I need the full transcript to search for code examples and key phrases. This tests if the agent can use `youtube_transcripts` to fetch a transcript, handling cases where one might not exist.
**Modules**: youtube_transcripts
**Bug Target**: Video transcript extraction.
**Expected Result**:
- Returns full transcript with timestamps
- Handles videos without transcripts gracefully
- Private/deleted videos return appropriate error
- Rate limiting prevents API bans

## Scenario 5: Convert a Product Datasheet to Markdown
**User Story & Rationale**: As a product manager, I have a vendor's product datasheet as a PDF. I need it in clean Markdown to include in our internal wiki, preserving all the specification tables. This tests `marker`'s ability to perform high-fidelity document conversion, a common data ingestion task.
**Modules**: marker
**Bug Target**: Document format conversion and structure preservation.
**Expected Result**:
- Converts PDF to clean Markdown preserving structure
- Handles scanned PDFs with OCR
- Preserves tables and lists formatting
- Large files (>100MB) process without OOM

## Scenario 6: "Ask Claude a Question"
**User Story & Rationale**: As a user, I have a complex reasoning question that no single tool can answer. I need to ask a powerful LLM for its thoughts. This tests the agent's ability to recognize a general knowledge or reasoning task and correctly route it to the `llm_call` module, managing provider selection and cost.
**Modules**: llm_call
**Bug Target**: Multi-provider LLM interface.
**Expected Result**:
- Routes to correct provider based on config
- Fallback works when primary provider fails
- Token limits respected
- Cost tracking accurate

## Scenario 7: Analyze a GitHub Repository
**User Story & Rationale**: As a software architect, I'm considering using a new open-source library. Before I dive in, I need a high-level overview: what language is it, how is it structured, and are there any red flags? This tests `gitget`'s ability to provide a quick, automated analysis of a code repository.
**Modules**: gitget
**Bug Target**: GitHub repository analysis.
**Expected Result**:
- Returns repo metadata: language, size, structure
- Handles large repos without timeout
- Private repos fail with clear auth error
- Code quality metrics (e.g., cyclomatic complexity) analyzed correctly

## Scenario 8: "Remember This Setting"
**User Story & Rationale**: As a user, I'm setting a preference: "For all future research, prioritize papers from the last 2 years." I expect the system to remember this across sessions. This tests the `world_model`'s ability to persist user-defined state that influences future agent behavior.
**Modules**: world_model
**Bug Target**: System state persistence and consistency.
**Expected Result**:
- State updates persist across restarts
- Concurrent updates don't cause race conditions
- State queries return consistent snapshots
- Rollback capability works

## Scenario 9: Evaluate a Decision
**User Story & Rationale**: As a system admin observing the agent, I've just seen it choose `llm_call` with GPT-4 for a simple task. I want to tell it, "That was too expensive, a local model would have been better." This tests the `rl_commons` module's ability to ingest a reward signal and update its policy.
**Modules**: rl_commons
**Bug Target**: Reinforcement learning optimization loop.
**Expected Result**:
- Bandit selection improves over time from feedback
- Rewards update Q-values correctly
- Exploration/exploitation balance is adjustable
- Handles cold start gracefully

## Scenario 10: "Generate a Report of Your Last Task"
**User Story & Rationale**: As a manager, I need a summary of what the GRANGER agent just did to investigate a security flaw. I need a clean, readable report. This tests the `claude-test-reporter`'s ability to synthesize actions and results into a formatted document.
**Modules**: claude-test-reporter
**Bug Target**: Test report generation and formatting.
**Expected Result**:
- Generates valid Markdown/HTML reports
- Includes all relevant steps from the agent's recent activity
- Handles reporting on task failures gracefully

# Level 1: Binary Module Interactions (Automating Simple Workflows)

These scenarios test the agent's ability to chain two modules to fulfill a common, multi-step user request. This is where dynamic pipeline weaknesses begin to appear.

## Scenario 11: "Download and Prep a Paper for Review"
**User Story & Rationale**: As a research scientist, I want to find a paper on ArXiv and immediately get it as clean Markdown, so I can start annotating and adding it to my notes without manual conversion. This tests the agent's ability to dynamically chain an input `arxiv-mcp-server` to a processing module `marker`.
**Modules**: arxiv-mcp-server, marker
**Bug Target**: PDF data handoff between modules, unicode handling.
**Expected Result**:
- ArXiv provides a valid PDF URL or file content.
- Marker successfully ingests and converts the PDF from ArXiv.
- Metadata (title, authors) is preserved through the pipeline.

## Scenario 12: "Scan this DEFCON Talk for New Vulnerabilities"
**User Story & Rationale**: As a threat intelligence analyst, I'm watching a YouTube video of a DEFCON talk where hackers are discussing new exploits. I need the system to "listen" and pull out any CVEs mentioned. This tests a creative, non-obvious pipeline: `youtube_transcripts` -> `sparta`, to find structured threats in unstructured spoken content.
**Modules**: youtube_transcripts, sparta
**Bug Target**: Cross-domain analysis, correctly identifying entities (CVEs) in noisy text.
**Expected Result**:
- YouTube provides a security-related transcript.
- SPARTA successfully identifies CVEs mentioned in the transcript text.
- Timestamps from the transcript align with CVE mentions.

## Scenario 13: "Read and Index this PDF Report"
**User Story & Rationale**: As an analyst, I have a 200-page industry report in PDF format. I need to ingest it into our knowledge base so I can search its full content and query its structure later. This tests the `marker` -> `arangodb` pipeline, the foundation of building a knowledge graph from documents.
**Modules**: marker, arangodb
**Bug Target**: Storing structured Markdown and metadata correctly in a graph database.
**Expected Result**:
- Converted Markdown from Marker is stored with its structure preserved (headings, lists).
- Full-text search on the content in ArangoDB works.
- Metadata is stored in a separate, linked collection.

## Scenario 14: "Prepare a Training Dataset from our Knowledge Graph"
**User Story & Rationale**: As an ML engineer, I need to create a Q&A dataset to fine-tune a Llama model. The source data is all the documents stored in our knowledge graph. This tests the `arangodb` -> `unsloth` pipeline, ensuring data can be correctly queried and formatted for model training.
**Modules**: arangodb, unsloth
**Bug Target**: Data extraction, formatting, and validation for ML training.
**Expected Result**:
- Graph queries from ArangoDB return training-ready data pairs (e.g., context, question, answer).
- Data format matches Unsloth's expected input schema.
- Large datasets are handled efficiently without memory overload.

## Scenario 15: "Index a GitHub Repo into our Knowledge Base"
**User Story & Rationale**: As a lead developer, I want our team's main repository to be fully searchable and understood by the GRANGER system, linking code to documentation and issues. This tests the `gitget` -> `arangodb` pipeline, turning a file system structure into a queryable code graph.
**Modules**: gitget, arangodb
**Bug Target**: Mapping file and code structures into a graph, handling large repos.
**Expected Result**:
- Repository structure (directories, files) is preserved as a graph in ArangoDB.
- Relationships (e.g., function calls, imports) are mapped as edges.
- Search queries for code snippets are performant.

## Scenario 16: "Learn from Your Own Actions"
**User Story & Rationale**: As a system administrator, I want the agent to learn from its successes and failures. If a chosen pipeline works well, it should be rewarded and more likely to be used again. This tests the core feedback loop: `world_model` (capturing state/actions) -> `rl_commons` (learning from them).
**Modules**: world_model, rl_commons
**Bug Target**: State-action-reward signal passing, policy updates.
**Expected Result**:
- State changes logged in `world_model` correctly trigger RL updates in `rl_commons`.
- Reward signals are computed correctly based on task success/failure.
- The agent's policy measurably improves (e.g., converges on a better pipeline).

## Scenario 17: "Keep our Vulnerability Database Updated"
**User Story & Rationale**: As a CISO, I need a persistent, searchable database of all relevant CVEs that `sparta` finds, not just one-off checks. This tests the `sparta` -> `arangodb` pipeline for data persistence, ensuring security findings are stored for historical analysis.
**Modules**: sparta, arangodb
**Bug Target**: Data deduplication, efficient bulk inserts, and relationship mapping.
**Expected Result**:
- CVE data from SPARTA is stored with all fields.
- Relationships between CVEs (e.g., 'related to') are maintained.
- Updates to existing CVEs don't create duplicate entries.

## Scenario 18: "Analyze this Test Failure"
**User Story & Rationale**: As a QA engineer, a complex integration test failed. I want the AI to look at the logs, summarize the failure, and suggest a root cause in the final report. This tests the `llm_call` -> `claude-test-reporter` pipeline, using AI to enhance reporting.
**Modules**: llm_call, claude-test-reporter
**Bug Target**: Passing structured log data to an LLM and formatting its unstructured analysis into a report.
**Expected Result**:
- LLM correctly analyzes test failure logs and provides a plausible summary.
- The LLM's insight is correctly embedded into the final report from `claude-test-reporter`.
- Cost of the LLM call is tracked per analysis.

## Scenario 19: "Optimize the System's Task Routing"
**User Story & Rationale**: As a system architect, I want the central `granger_hub` to get smarter about which spoke module to use for a given task, based on performance and success rates. This tests the central `granger_hub` -> `rl_commons` interaction, where the hub's decisions are guided and improved over time.
**Modules**: granger_hub, rl_commons
**Bug Target**: The core optimization loop of the entire system.
**Expected Result**:
- The hub's routing decisions for specific tasks (e.g., "find a paper") improve over time.
- Load balancing across redundant modules is effective.
- The `rl_commons` policy correctly reflects the empirical performance of different spokes.

## Scenario 20: "Deploy our Fine-Tuned Model"
**User Story & Rationale**: As an ML engineer, we just finished fine-tuning a model with `unsloth`. I now want to make it available for use throughout the Granger system as a new LLM option. This tests the `unsloth` -> `llm_call` pipeline, closing the loop from training to inference.
**Modules**: unsloth, llm_call
**Bug Target**: Model registration, API compatibility, performance.
**Expected Result**:
- Fine-tuned models from `unsloth` become callable via the `llm_call` interface.
- Performance of the fine-tuned model on specific tasks is measurably better than the base model.
- Fallback to a base model works if the fine-tuned one fails.

# Level 2: Multi-Module Workflows (Complex, Goal-Oriented Tasks)

These scenarios test the agent's ability to plan and execute complex, multi-step workflows that are central to a researcher's or engineer's job. Failures here point to critical flaws in the agent's planning and state management logic.

## Scenario 21: "Build a Custom Model from the Latest Research"
**User Story & Rationale**: As an ML engineer, I want to create a model that's an expert on "quantum cryptography". The agent needs to find all relevant papers, process them, store the knowledge, and then use that to fine-tune a base model. This is the ultimate research-to-training pipeline, testing the agent's ability to manage a long-running, high-value project.
**Modules**: arxiv-mcp-server, marker, arangodb, unsloth
**Bug Target**: End-to-end data integrity, error recovery in long chains, resource management.
**Expected Result**:
- Papers are found (`arxiv`), converted (`marker`), stored (`arangodb`), and used for training (`unsloth`).
- The agent can filter out low-quality or irrelevant papers.
- The final model's performance on quantum crypto questions is measurably improved.

## Scenario 22: "Create a Daily Security Intelligence Briefing"
**User Story & Rationale**: As a CISO, I want an automated daily briefing that summarizes new CVEs, cross-references them with any chatter from security conference talks on YouTube, uses an LLM to synthesize the key threats, and delivers it as a clean report. This tests the agent's ability to synthesize information from multiple, disparate sources (`sparta`, `youtube_transcripts`) into a coherent intelligence product.
**Modules**: sparta, youtube_transcripts, llm_call, claude-test-reporter
**Bug Target**: Data correlation, synthesizing structured and unstructured data, report generation.
**Expected Result**:
- CVEs from `sparta` are correctly correlated with discussions from `youtube_transcripts`.
- `llm_call` generates an actionable, concise summary of the key threats.
- The final report from `claude-test-reporter` is automatically generated and delivered.

## Scenario 23: "Build a Knowledge Graph Linking Papers to Code"
**User Story & Rationale**: As a research scientist, I want to explore the real-world impact of academic papers. When I look up a paper, I also want to see the GitHub repositories that implement its ideas. This tests the agent's ability to build a multi-modal knowledge graph, linking academic knowledge (`arxiv`) with practical implementations (`gitget`).
**Modules**: arxiv-mcp-server, gitget, arangerdb, world_model
**Bug Target**: Entity resolution (matching paper concepts to code), complex graph relationship creation.
**Expected Result**:
- The graph in `arangodb` contains nodes for papers and repos.
- Edges correctly link papers to the code that implements them.
- Queries like "show me the code for the 'Attention Is All You Need' paper" work correctly.

## Scenario 24: "Create a Personalized Learning Path for a Topic"
**User Story & Rationale**: As a student, I want to learn about "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback." I need the system to find beginner-friendly tutorials on YouTube, process them, identify key concepts, and then use an LLM to structure a personalized learning plan for me. This tests the agent's ability to act as an adaptive tutor.
**Modules**: youtube_transcripts, marker, llm_call, rl_commons
**Bug Target**: Content understanding, curriculum generation, user progress tracking.
**Expected Result**:
- The agent identifies relevant tutorial content from `youtube_transcripts`.
- Key concepts are correctly identified and structured by `llm_call`.
- A logical learning path is generated, and `rl_commons` can be used to adapt it based on user feedback.

*...The same "User Story & Rationale" format would be applied to all remaining scenarios, from 25 through 67. The key is to always frame the test in terms of what a real human user is trying to accomplish.*

---

*For brevity, I'll provide a few more high-level examples to illustrate how the unique bug hunter scenarios would be framed.*

# Bug Hunter Unique Scenarios (System Resilience & Health)

These scenarios are from the perspective of a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) or a systems architect responsible for the stability and security of the Granger ecosystem itself. The "user" is an internal one.

## Scenario 43: Module Resilience Testing
**User Story & Rationale**: As a Granger SRE, I know the agent might chain modules in unexpected ways, potentially sending garbage output from one module to the input of another. I need to ensure every module is robust enough to handle malformed, unexpected, or malicious input without crashing the entire system. This tests the fundamental input validation and error handling of each spoke.
**Bug Target**: Input validation, error handling, resource limits.
**Expected Result**:
- Malformed inputs (e.g., binary data instead of text) are rejected with a clear error.
- Resource exhaustion (e.g., a "zip bomb" PDF for `marker`) is prevented.
- Modules degrade gracefully rather than crashing.

## Scenario 50: Error Cascade Hunter
**User Story & Rationale**: As a Granger operator, if the `arxiv` module goes down due to an API change, I absolutely cannot have this failure cascade and take down the entire `granger_hub`. A single point of failure is unacceptable. This test simulates a failure in a dependent module to ensure the agent's orchestration logic (circuit breakers, fallbacks) contains the blast radius and prevents a system-wide outage.
**Bug Target**: Error propagation, retry storms, lack of fault isolation.
**Expected Result**:
- Errors are contained within the calling function.
- Exponential backoff and circuit breakers prevent retry storms.
- The agent can try an alternative plan (e.g., "I can't access ArXiv, but I can still search our internal graph").

## Scenario 52: Security Boundary Hunter
**User Story & Rationale**: As a security engineer for Granger, I need to ensure that a task running for a low-privilege user cannot access or modify data from a high-privilege user's project. The agent's dynamic nature must not create a pathway for privilege escalation. This test probes the authentication and authorization boundaries between modules and data stores.
**Bug Target**: Authentication, authorization, audit trails.
**Expected Result**:
- All inter-module calls are authenticated.
- `arangodb` enforces graph permissions correctly (e.g., user A cannot see user B's nodes).
- No path allows one user's request to escalate its own privileges.

# Clarifying Questiosn for Claude Code to Answer
**Refining Analysis Approach**

I'm now focused on refining my approach to re-analyzing the provided document. I'm currently honing my understanding of the user's request, ensuring I grasp the nuances of the instructions, particularly the need to identify areas for further improvement in the updated document. I'm taking care to prevent duplicating the improvements already identified.


**Identifying Test Gaps**

I'm now digging into the current state of the scenarios and identifying what's missing. It's becoming clear that while I addressed the initial request, there's a critical gap: testing the dynamic pipeline *decision-making* process within the `granger_hub`. I'm now focusing on crafting scenarios that probe the hub's emergent behavior, specifically its handling of unexpected or suboptimal pipeline choices.


**Probing the Gaps**

I'm now pivoting to explore areas where the existing work could be expanded. I've identified shortcomings: testing the dynamic decision-making within the `granger_hub` is key, but the current test suite lacks depth. I must ensure the `rl_commons` and the evaluation of "Expected Result" are tested in the context of real-world messiness, to create a much more solid test suite.


**Expanding the Test Suite**

I'm now focusing on expanding the testing methodology. The existing scenarios test happy paths, but to truly push the agent, I must introduce ambiguity, underspecification, and real-world "messiness" into the scenarios. I'm specifically developing questions about testing the `granger_hub` in unforeseen circumstances. I am preparing to ask clarifying questions externally, as the instructions dictate.


**Questioning for Clarity**

I'm now synthesizing my internal critiques into actionable questions for the user. These will be structured and categorized to ensure the human response can be easily integrated. The focus is on the "Chooser," and `rl_commons`. I'm preparing to query the user for details on how to formulate the right scenarios. I'm already formulating specific questions to ensure that I understand how the system should respond to bad decisions.


**Generating Detailed Questions**

I'm now in the final stages of preparing my questions. I've focused on the "Chooser", `rl_commons`, user ambiguity, and world model state. I'm aiming for specific and actionable inquiries to identify areas for improvement. The primary goal is to elicit information on how to devise scenarios for the dynamic pipeline decision-making, and how best to evaluate the emergent behavior of the `granger_hub` within more real-world contexts, and to test memory.


**Preparing Further Inquiries**

I'm now shifting focus to organizing my upcoming query to the user. It's crucial to ensure the user feedback is easily integrated. I am now breaking down the existing work into key categories. This will allow the user to provide targeted feedback for me to improve, in particular, around the "Chooser", and the `rl_commons`. I'm readying my final questions.


**Synthesizing Actionable Questions**

I'm now finalizing the structure of my queries, ensuring clear and actionable questions for the user. The aim is to directly address the areas for improvement in the existing document. These are focused on the "Chooser," `rl_commons`, ambiguity, and `world_model` testing, to ensure a robust and improved set of scenarios. I will present it as an organized set of questions to make user feedback easier to apply.


Excellent question. It forces a meta-level analysis of the process itself.

Yes, after re-analyzing the document and the core mission, I believe we can significantly improve it. The current version successfully adds the "why" (the User Story), which is a crucial first step. However, it still primarily tests pre-determined "good" pipelines.

The core goal you stated is to **"find weaknesses [and] errors between project (spoke) interactions where a static pipeline is not defined--the agent (granger_hub) is choosing which spoke modules to call and in what order."**

My previous improvement helps `rl_commons` grade a chosen pipeline, but it doesn't do enough to test the `granger_hub`'s *ability to choose or construct that pipeline in the first place*, especially when the path isn't obvious.

To truly test the agent's dynamic decision-making, I need to understand more about the intended behavior and failure modes. Here are my clarifying questions, categorized for clarity.

---

### Clarifying Questions for the Human (You)

#### **1. Regarding the "Chooser" (`granger_hub`) Logic:**

The current scenarios implicitly define the correct pipeline (e.g., "Research to Training Workflow" lists the 4 modules to use). To test the *chooser*, we need scenarios that challenge its selection process.

*   **Question 1a (Ambiguity):** Real-world requests are often ambiguous. For example, a user might say, "Summarize the latest on PQC from NIST." Does this require `sparta` (for CVEs), `arxiv-mcp-server` (for academic papers), or a general web search (not a current module)? **Should I design scenarios with ambiguous user prompts where the agent's first step must be to either clarify the intent or make a "best guess" and potentially choose a suboptimal pipeline?**
*   **Question 1b (Nonsensical Pipelines):** The most revealing bugs in a chooser come from it making nonsensical choices. For example, trying to feed a YouTube transcript (`youtube_transcripts`) into the PDF converter (`marker`). **Should I create "trap" scenarios designed to tempt the agent into creating illogical or nonsensical pipelines?** The goal would be to test its internal logic and constraints.

#### **2. Regarding the "Grader" (`rl_commons`) and Reward Signals:**

The quality of the reinforcement learning depends entirely on the quality of the reward signal. "Success" or "failure" is often not binary.

*   **Question 2a (Granularity of Rewards):** How is a "good" pipeline differentiated from a "great" one? For example, two pipelines might both successfully answer a user's query, but one might have been much faster or cheaper (e.g., used a local model via `llm_call` instead of a premium API). **Should the "Expected Result" be expanded to include success criteria beyond just the final output?** For instance:
    *   `Max Cost: $0.05`
    *   `Max Latency: 10 seconds`
    *   `Result Quality Score: >0.8` (as determined by a final `llm_call` critic)
*   **Question 2b (User Feedback Loop):** How is user satisfaction captured? A pipeline could technically succeed but produce an unhelpful result. Is there a mechanism for the user to provide feedback like "This wasn't what I wanted" or "That was perfect!" that feeds directly into `rl_commons` as a reward/penalty? **If so, should I create scenarios that test this feedback loop explicitly?** For example:
    1.  Agent produces a result.
    2.  Simulated user provides negative feedback.
    3.  Agent is given the same prompt again.
    4.  **Test:** Does the agent choose a *different* pipeline this time?

#### **3. Regarding the "Memory" (`world_model`) and Context:**

A smart agent uses memory to improve. The `world_model` is key here, but its practical application in pipeline construction isn't heavily tested yet.

*   **Question 3a (Personalization):** Should the agent's choice of pipeline adapt to a specific user's habits over time? For example, if a user consistently asks `sparta` about hardware vulnerabilities, the agent might learn to prioritize that source for this user's security queries. **Should I design scenarios that span multiple interactions to test if the `world_model`'s state correctly influences and improves future pipeline choices for a specific user context?**
*   **Question 3b (Self-Correction):** If a pipeline fails (e.g., `arxiv-mcp-server` is down), the agent should not only recover but also *remember* that the module is unreliable. The `world_model` should track module health. **Should scenarios test this long-term memory?** For example:
    1.  Simulate `arxiv` API failure.
    2.  Agent attempts a pipeline and it fails. `world_model` is updated.
    3.  A few interactions later, the user makes another research request.
    4.  **Test:** Does the agent's chosen pipeline now show a bias *against* using `arxiv` or does it include a check for its health before trying?

---

### External Research (Hypothetical)

Based on Question 1a, I might perform external research on: *"common patterns in ambiguous user queries to AI assistants"* or *"taxonomies of user intent in scientific research queries."* This would help me craft more realistic and challenging prompts for the agent.

### Proposed Next Iteration

Based on your answers, I propose to iterate on the document by:

1.  **Adding a New Level: "Level X: Ambiguous & Dynamic Scenarios".** This level would contain scenarios with underspecified prompts, forcing the `granger_hub` to demonstrate its reasoning, clarification, and pipeline construction capabilities under uncertainty.
2.  **Enhancing `Expected Result` with `Success Metrics`.** I will add fields for `Cost`, `Latency`, and `Quality` to the scenarios, providing a much richer target for `rl_commons` to optimize against.
3.  **Creating Multi-Turn Scenarios.** I will design chained scenarios (e.g., Scenario 70.1, 70.2, 70.3) that test the agent's memory, adaptation, and learning over time, specifically targeting the `world_model` -> `rl_commons` -> `granger_hub` feedback loop.

Please provide your feedback on these questions. Your answers will allow me to refine these test scenarios to be far more effective at hunting the specific, complex bugs we're looking for.

## Claude's Authoritative Answers to Gemini's Questions

*Based on comprehensive analysis of the GRANGER ecosystem documentation, architecture, and testing requirements*

### 1. Regarding the "Chooser" (`granger_hub`) Logic:

**Answer to Question 1a (Ambiguity):** 
Yes, absolutely! Ambiguous user prompts are essential for testing real-world agent intelligence. The GRANGER hub must be tested with scenarios that reflect actual user behavior:

- **Design scenarios with ambiguous prompts** where multiple valid interpretations exist
- **Test the agent's clarification strategies** - does it ask follow-up questions or make intelligent assumptions based on context?
- **Include underspecified requests** that require the hub to infer missing information

For the example "Summarize the latest on PQC from NIST":
- The hub should recognize this could mean: CVE vulnerabilities (SPARTA), academic papers (ArXiv), or YouTube conference talks
- Ideal behavior: Either clarify with user OR execute parallel pipelines and synthesize results
- The World Model should influence decisions based on user history (e.g., "this user typically wants CVEs")

**Answer to Question 1b (Nonsensical Pipelines):**
Yes! "Trap" scenarios are crucial for validating the hub's internal logic and constraints. The agent must demonstrate understanding of module capabilities, not just pattern matching:

Critical nonsensical pipelines to test:
- YouTube transcript â†’ Marker PDF converter (incompatible data types)
- ArangoDB query â†’ Unsloth training without data extraction (missing intermediate steps)
- GitGet code â†’ SPARTA CVE analysis (code is not vulnerability data)
- Binary file â†’ YouTube transcript processor (wrong media type)

The hub should have explicit constraints preventing these illogical chains. Failure to reject these indicates a fundamental flaw in the agent's understanding of module purposes.

### 2. Regarding the "Grader" (`rl_commons`) and Reward Signals:

**Answer to Question 2a (Granularity of Rewards):**
Yes, expand Expected Results to include multi-dimensional success criteria. The RL Commons module needs rich signals to learn nuanced trade-offs:

```yaml
Expected Result Structure:
  output_quality:
    correctness: boolean          # Did it answer the question?
    completeness: 0.0-1.0        # How thorough was the answer?
    relevance: 0.0-1.0           # Signal-to-noise ratio
    accuracy: 0.0-1.0            # Factual correctness
    
  performance_metrics:
    max_cost: $0.05              # Budget constraint
    actual_cost: $0.03           # What was spent
    max_latency: 10s             # Time constraint
    actual_latency: 7.2s         # Actual time
    tokens_used: 3500            # Resource consumption
    
  pipeline_efficiency:
    modules_used: 3              # Should minimize
    parallel_execution: true     # Did it parallelize where possible?
    cache_hits: 0.75            # Reuse of previous computations
    redundant_calls: 0          # Avoided duplicate work?
    
  quality_scores:
    user_goal_alignment: 0.9    # How well did it meet user intent?
    technical_correctness: 1.0  # Was the pipeline technically sound?
    creativity: 0.7             # Novel but valid approach?
```

The RL system should learn to balance these competing objectives based on context.

**Answer to Question 2b (User Feedback Loop):**
Absolutely critical! The feedback mechanism must be tested thoroughly:

Test scenarios for different feedback types:
1. **Immediate explicit feedback**: "That wasn't helpful" â†’ agent must try different approach
2. **Delayed feedback**: User rates result hours later â†’ Q-values updated retroactively
3. **Implicit negative signals**: User abandons task â†’ infer dissatisfaction
4. **Comparative feedback**: "The previous answer was better" â†’ relative reward calculation
5. **Contextual feedback**: "Too technical" â†’ adjust future responses for this user

Key test: After negative feedback on identical prompt, the agent MUST choose a different pipeline. This verifies the RL Commons policy actually updates from experience.

### 3. Regarding the "Memory" (`world_model`) and Context:

**Answer to Question 3a (Personalization):**
Yes! The World Model must enable sophisticated user-specific adaptations:

User context tracking should include:
- **Preference patterns**: "User A prefers academic sources, User B prefers practical examples"
- **Expertise levels**: "This user understands ML jargon, simplify for this other user"
- **Temporal patterns**: "This user's 'recent' means last 24 hours, not last month"
- **Domain focus**: "Security queries from this user usually mean hardware vulnerabilities"
- **Cost sensitivity**: "This user prioritizes speed over cost"

Multi-turn test scenarios:
```yaml
personalization_test_chain:
  interaction_1:
    user: "Show me the latest on transformers"
    agent_response: [returns ML papers]
    user_feedback: "I meant electrical transformers"
    
  interaction_2:
    user: "What's new with transformers?"
    expected: Agent should bias toward electrical engineering content
    test: Did World Model influence pipeline selection?
```

**Answer to Question 3b (Self-Correction):**
Essential for production resilience! The World Model must track system health dynamically:

Module health tracking requirements:
1. **Failure tracking**: Failed calls increase "unreliability score"
2. **Recovery detection**: Periodic health checks to detect when modules recover
3. **Performance degradation**: Track response time trends
4. **Cascading failure prevention**: Don't retry failed modules in rapid succession

Test scenario example:
```yaml
self_correction_test:
  setup:
    - Simulate ArXiv API returning 500 errors
    
  phase_1:
    - User requests research papers
    - Agent tries ArXiv, fails
    - World Model updates: arxiv_reliability = 0.2
    
  phase_2: (5 minutes later)
    - User requests different papers
    - Expected: Agent prioritizes alternative sources or includes health check
    - Test: Does pipeline avoid or carefully probe ArXiv?
    
  phase_3: (next day)
    - ArXiv is working again
    - User requests papers
    - Expected: Agent gradually reintroduces ArXiv after successful health check
    - Test: Does World Model support gradual trust rebuilding?
```

### Additional Critical Testing Recommendations:

**1. State Consistency Under Concurrency:**
```python
# Test concurrent user requests don't corrupt World Model state
async def test_concurrent_personalization():
    user_a_task = agent.process("User A: I prefer technical details")
    user_b_task = agent.process("User B: Keep it simple")
    await asyncio.gather(user_a_task, user_b_task)
    
    # Verify User A's preferences didn't leak to User B
    assert world_model.get_user_preference("A", "complexity") == "high"
    assert world_model.get_user_preference("B", "complexity") == "low"
```

**2. Pipeline Construction Under Resource Constraints:**
```yaml
resource_constraint_test:
  constraints:
    total_budget: $0.10
    time_limit: 5s
    gpu_available: false
    
  request: "Fine-tune a model for quantum cryptography"
  
  expected_behavior:
    - Recognizes Unsloth needs GPU (not available)
    - Adapts to use lighter-weight alternatives
    - Stays within budget by choosing efficient pipelines
    - Provides clear explanation of constraints to user
```

**3. Chaos Engineering for Hub Resilience:**
```yaml
chaos_scenarios:
  module_flakiness:
    - Make Marker fail 30% of requests randomly
    - Test: Does hub implement retry with backoff?
    
  cascade_prevention:
    - Make ArXiv timeout trigger YouTube API to also timeout
    - Test: Does hub prevent cascade failures?
    
  byzantine_behavior:
    - Make LLM Call return plausible but incorrect responses
    - Test: Does hub have consistency checks?
```

### Implementation Priority Order:

1. **First**: Implement ambiguous prompt scenarios (Question 1a) - these test the most fundamental capability
2. **Second**: Add multi-dimensional reward structures (Question 2a) - enables sophisticated optimization
3. **Third**: Build user feedback loops (Question 2b) - critical for real-world learning
4. **Fourth**: Implement personalization tests (Question 3a) - differentiates good from great systems
5. **Fifth**: Add self-correction capabilities (Question 3b) - essential for production reliability

These comprehensive answers provide the foundation for creating a bug hunting framework that will expose real weaknesses in the GRANGER hub's dynamic decision-making, not just test predetermined pipelines.
