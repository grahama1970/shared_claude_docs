# Comprehensive Test Plan Based on All Inputs

## Understanding Confirmed ✓

I understand from your message and Gemini's response that:

1. **Testing will be progressive** (Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3)
2. **Some scenarios require a complete pipeline** where:
   - SPARTA has ingested all security data
   - Marker has extracted documents
   - ArangoDB has built relationships and Q&A tuples
   - Unsloth has fine-tuned models with LoRA adapters

## Test Scenario Categories Created

### 1. Space Cybersecurity Scenarios (100+)
- Location: 
- Complex orchestrations for satellite security
- Assumes full pipeline for Level 3

### 2. Everyday Interaction Scenarios (92)
- Location: 
- Practical daily tasks
- Three complexity levels clearly defined

### 3. Gemini-Inspired Scenarios (20)
- Location: 
- Advanced patterns like visual analysis, knowledge graphs
- Excellent examples of Level 3 complexity

### 4. Test-Aware Scenarios (New)
- Location: 
- Explicitly note prerequisites
- Progressive testing approach

## Testing Progression Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality (Week 1)
**No Prerequisites - Level 1**
- Module health checks
- Basic I/O tests
- Simple single-module operations

**Example**: "Get recent ArXiv papers on quantum computing"


### Phase 2: Initial Integration (Week 2-3)
**Partial Prerequisites - Level 2**
- Load SPARTA NIST controls
- Extract 10-20 documents with Marker
- Create basic ArangoDB graph
- Test 2-3 module combinations

**Example**: "Check code for SQL injection vulnerabilities"


### Phase 3: Full Pipeline (Week 4-6)
**Complete Prerequisites - Level 3**
- All SPARTA data ingested
- 100+ documents extracted
- Rich ArangoDB relationships
- Q&A tuples generated
- Models fine-tuned

**Example**: Gemini Scenario #123 "AI-Powered Anomaly Detection"


## Key Testing Insights

### From Your Requirements:
1. Real scenarios need real data
2. Complex scenarios need the full pipeline
3. Testing must be incremental
4. Each level builds on the previous

### From Gemini's Examples:
1. Visual analysis is powerful (MCP Screenshot → LLM)
2. Knowledge graphs are central (ArangoDB hub)
3. Fine-tuned models are essential (Unsloth specialization)
4. Human feedback improves systems (Marker Ground Truth)

### From Implementation Experience:
1. Start with heartbeat tests
2. Build data progressively
3. Test integrations incrementally
4. Validate before advancing

## Prerequisite Verification Functions



## Test Execution Strategy

1. **Run Level 1 First** - Verify installation
2. **Load Required Data** - Build prerequisites
3. **Run Level 2** - Test integrations
4. **Complete Pipeline** - Ingest, extract, relate, tune
5. **Run Level 3** - Test complex scenarios
6. **Run Gemini Scenarios** - Ultimate validation

## Success Metrics

- Level 1: All modules respond (100% pass)
- Level 2: Integrations work (>90% pass)
- Level 3: Complex scenarios complete (>80% pass)
- Gemini: Advanced scenarios run (>70% pass)

## Next Actions

1. Set up test environment
2. Install all modules
3. Create test data loaders
4. Build prerequisite checkers
5. Execute progressive test plan

The journey from "hello world" to Gemini's sophisticated scenarios is mapped and ready!
