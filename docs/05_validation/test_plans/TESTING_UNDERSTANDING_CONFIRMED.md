# Testing Understanding Confirmed

## Yes, I Understand the Requirements!

You need scenarios for testing the Claude Module Communicator at three levels, with some scenarios requiring a complete operational pipeline.

## The Full Pipeline Required for Level 3

1. **SPARTA** has ingested:
   - NIST controls
   - MITRE CWE database  
   - MITRE ATT&CK framework
   - STIX threat intelligence

2. **Marker** has extracted:
   - Security documents
   - Technical specifications
   - Compliance standards
   - Research papers

3. **ArangoDB** has:
   - Built knowledge graphs
   - Created relationships
   - Generated Q&A tuples
   - Stored historical data

4. **Unsloth** has:
   - Fine-tuned models with LoRA adapters
   - Domain-specific specializations
   - Validated performance improvements

## Testing Levels Mapped to Prerequisites

### Level 1 Testing (No Prerequisites)
- Test basic module functionality
- Verify installations work
- Simple single-module operations
- Can run immediately after install

### Level 2 Testing (Partial Data)
- Requires some data loaded
- Basic integrations work
- 2-3 module combinations
- Need SPARTA basics + some extracted docs

### Level 3 Testing (Full Pipeline) 
- Requires complete data pipeline
- Complex multi-module orchestrations
- Like Gemini scenarios 121-140
- Need everything operational

## Gemini Scenarios Show the Goal

The Gemini response demonstrates what we're building toward:
- Sophisticated threat detection
- Automated compliance checking
- AI-powered analysis with fine-tuned models
- Knowledge synthesis from multiple sources

## Our Testing Strategy

1. **Start Simple**: Verify each module works
2. **Build Data**: Progressively load SPARTA, extract with Marker
3. **Create Relationships**: Build ArangoDB graphs and Q&A
4. **Fine-tune Models**: Train Unsloth on domain data
5. **Test Complex**: Run full pipeline scenarios

## I'm Ready to Create:

1. Module verification tests (Level 1)
2. Integration tests with partial data (Level 2)  
3. Full pipeline tests like Gemini's (Level 3)
4. Progressive test plans
5. Prerequisite checking scripts

The key insight: We can't jump to Level 3 without building the foundation!
