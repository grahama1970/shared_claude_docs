## Next Steps (Tasks #004-005)

5. Commit all changes with detailed message

## Notes
- Most files were untracked by git, so regular `mv` was used instead of `git mv`
- Git history preserved where possible
- No files were deleted, only moved or archived
- Structure now clearly follows: Research → Strategy → Planning → Implementation → Validation → Operations
