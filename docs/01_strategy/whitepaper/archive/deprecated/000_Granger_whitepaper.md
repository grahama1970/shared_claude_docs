# GRANGER: Graph-Reinforced AI Network for General Enterprise Research

## Executive Summary

GRANGER provides a unique capability for aerospace and defense organizations: automated detection of divergences between documentation and implementation through graph-based relationship analysis. Unlike existing compliance tools that perform simple text searches or requirements tracking, GRANGER constructs a knowledge graph connecting specifications, code, test results, and compliance frameworks to identify inconsistencies that manual review routinely misses. The system processes 1,000+ pages per hour with 95% extraction accuracy, reducing documentation review cycles from months to weeks.

## The Technical Problem

Aerospace and defense programs face a fundamental challenge: ensuring that what is documented matches what is implemented. Current approaches fail because:

### Documentation-Code Divergence
- Specifications evolve independently from code implementations
- Manual reviews sample only 10-20% of documentation
- No automated tools verify documentation against actual code behavior
- Changes in one artifact rarely propagate to related documents

### Existing Tool Limitations
- **Requirements Management Tools** (Jama, DOORS): Track requirements but don't verify implementation
- **Static Analysis Tools** (Klocwork, LDRA): Analyze code but don't connect to documentation
- **Document Management Systems** (OpenText, Alfresco): Store documents without understanding relationships
- **Compliance Tools** (Perforce, ComplianceQuest): Check against standards but miss implementation details

## GRANGER's Technical Approach

### 1. Code Understanding via Tree-Sitter
GRANGER employs tree-sitter parsers to understand code structure across multiple languages:
- Extracts function signatures, class hierarchies, and module dependencies
- Maps code elements to documentation references
- Identifies undocumented functionality and orphaned specifications
- Supports Python, JavaScript, C/C++, Rust, and 20+ languages

### 2. Graph-Based Relationship Modeling
Using ArangoDB, GRANGER builds a comprehensive knowledge graph:
```
Document → specifies → Function → implements → Requirement
    ↓                      ↓                        ↓
references              tested_by                maps_to
    ↓                      ↓                        ↓
Standard ← validates ← Test_Result ← verifies ← Control
```

### 3. Real-Time Verification with Live Inputs
The Marker module extends beyond static document analysis:
- **Hardware Data Stream Integration**: Processes telemetry, sensor data, and test results
- **Live Verification**: Compares real-time system behavior against specifications
- **Dynamic Graph Updates**: Relationships evolve as new data arrives
- **Continuous Compliance**: Detects drift between documentation and actual performance
- **Multi-Format Support**: Handles SCADA, CAN bus, MIL-STD-1553, and custom protocols

### 4. Autonomous Self-Evolution
GRANGER continuously evolves through multiple learning mechanisms:
- **Client-Specific Adaptation**: Learns your organization's patterns and customizes analysis
- **Scientific Literature Integration**: ArXiv Bot autonomously searches for papers to:
  - Implement new verification techniques
  - Bolster existing project approaches with evidence
  - Identify contradicting research that may impact assumptions
- **RL-Based Optimization**: Improves routing, model selection, and accuracy through usage
- **Approval-Gated Evolution**: All improvements require client approval before activation

## Real-World Capabilities

### Documentation-Code-Hardware Verification
GRANGER identifies divergences across three domains:
- **Static Analysis**: Functions in code vs. documentation
- **Dynamic Verification**: Live system behavior vs. specifications
- **Research Validation**: Current implementation vs. latest scientific findings

### Example Real-Time Analysis
```
LIVE FINDING: Telemetry stream from Engine Control Unit
- Specification: Max temperature 850°C (SRS-3.4.2)
- Observed: Sustained 875°C during test cycle 4
- Code Review: Temperature limiter set to 880°C
- ArXiv Alert: Paper 2024.13579 suggests ceramic degradation at 870°C
- Status: CRITICAL - Three-way divergence detected

AUTONOMOUS FINDING: ArXiv paper "Improved Kalman Filtering for Aerospace"
- Relevance: 94% match to your navigation subsystem
- Improvement: 15% reduction in computational complexity
- Contradiction: Challenges assumption in NAV-SPEC-4.1
- Recommendation: Review with navigation team
- Status: Awaiting approval to generate implementation plan
```

### Continuous Learning from Your Environment
GRANGER adapts to each client's unique needs:
- **Terminology Learning**: Adopts your acronyms and naming conventions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learns your documentation structure and coding styles  
- **Priority Calibration**: Adjusts finding severity based on your feedback
- **Workflow Integration**: Adapts to your review and approval processes

### Cybersecurity Framework Integration
GRANGER maps between multiple frameworks simultaneously:
- **NIST SP 800-53**: 1,193 controls with implementation verification
- **MITRE ATT&CK**: Technique-to-code mapping
- **CVE/CWE**: Vulnerability pattern detection in code
- **CMMC**: Automated evidence collection for all 110 practices
