# GRANGER: Graph-Reinforced AI Network for General Enterprise Research

## Executive Summary

GRANGER provides a unique capability for aerospace and defense organizations: automated detection of divergences between documentation and implementation through graph-based relationship analysis. Unlike existing compliance tools that perform simple text searches or requirements tracking, GRANGER constructs a knowledge graph connecting specifications, code, test results, and compliance frameworks to identify inconsistencies that manual review routinely misses. The system processes 1,000+ pages per hour with 95% extraction accuracy, reducing documentation review cycles from months to weeks.

## The Technical Problem

Aerospace and defense programs face a fundamental challenge: ensuring that what is documented matches what is implemented. Current approaches fail because:

### Documentation-Code Divergence
- Specifications evolve independently from code implementations
- Manual reviews sample only 10-20% of documentation
- No automated tools verify documentation against actual code behavior
- Changes in one artifact rarely propagate to related documents

### Existing Tool Limitations
- **Requirements Management Tools** (Jama, DOORS): Track requirements but don't verify implementation
- **Static Analysis Tools** (Klocwork, LDRA): Analyze code but don't connect to documentation
- **Document Management Systems** (OpenText, Alfresco): Store documents without understanding relationships
- **Compliance Tools** (Perforce, ComplianceQuest): Check against standards but miss implementation details

## GRANGER's Technical Approach

### 1. Comprehensive Code Understanding
GRANGER employs multiple techniques to understand code across 30+ programming languages¹:
- **Hierarchical Analysis**: Understands nested structures and dependencies
- **Semantic Understanding**: Goes beyond syntax to grasp meaning and intent
- **Graph Relationships**: Maps how code components interact
- **BM25 Ranking**: Finds relevant code sections efficiently
- **Multilingual Support**: Handles documentation in multiple natural languages
- **Tree-sitter Integration**: One of many parsers for syntax analysis

### 2. Graph-Based Relationship Modeling
Using ArangoDB, GRANGER builds a comprehensive knowledge graph²:
```
Document → specifies → Function → implements → Requirement
    ↓                      ↓                        ↓
references              tested_by                maps_to
    ↓                      ↓                        ↓
Standard ← validates ← Test_Result ← verifies ← Control
```

### 3. Real-Time Verification with Live Inputs
The Marker module extends beyond static document analysis³:
- **Hardware Data Stream Integration**: Processes telemetry, sensor data, and test results
- **Live Verification**: Compares real-time system behavior against specifications
- **Dynamic Graph Updates**: Relationships evolve as new data arrives
- **Continuous Compliance**: Detects drift between documentation and actual performance
- **Multi-Format Support**: Handles SCADA, CAN bus, MIL-STD-1553, and custom protocols

### 4. Autonomous Self-Evolution
GRANGER continuously evolves through multiple learning mechanisms⁴:
- **Client-Specific Adaptation**: Learns your organization's patterns and customizes analysis
- **Scientific Literature Integration**: ArXiv Bot autonomously searches for papers to:
  - Implement new verification techniques
  - Bolster existing project approaches with evidence
  - Identify contradicting research that may impact assumptions
- **RL-Based Optimization**: Improves routing, model selection, and accuracy through usage
- **Approval-Gated Evolution**: All improvements require client approval before activation

## Real-World Capabilities

### Documentation-Code-Hardware Verification
GRANGER identifies divergences across three domains:
- **Static Analysis**: Functions in code vs. documentation
- **Dynamic Verification**: Live system behavior vs. specifications
- **Research Validation**: Current implementation vs. latest scientific findings

### Example Real-Time Analysis
```
RESEARCH-DRIVEN EVOLUTION: Continuous improvement cycle
- Searches technical papers AND transcripts for "redundancy patterns"
- Finds: New fault-tolerant voting algorithm in recent conference
- Self-Improvement: Proposes updating GRANGER's analysis capabilities
- Project Check: Your code uses older redundancy approach
- Dual Alert: "New technique available for both GRANGER and your project"
- Status: Awaiting approval to implement in both systems

AUTONOMOUS VALIDATION: Real-time research integration
- Monitors latest publications and technical presentations
- Extracts: Implementation patterns, best practices, warnings
- Validates: Your project against current state-of-the-art
- Evolves: GRANGER's own capabilities based on findings
- Human Control: All changes require explicit approval
```

### Continuous Multi-Source Learning
GRANGER autonomously learns from diverse sources⁶:
- **Scientific Literature**: Continuously searches ArXiv for relevant papers
- **Technical Transcripts**: Analyzes engineering presentations and lectures
- **Dual-Purpose Research**: Same content both improves GRANGER and validates client projects
- **Self-Evolution**: Implements new techniques from research (with approval)
- **Project Validation**: Checks if current implementation aligns with latest findings
- **Contradiction Detection**: Alerts when new research challenges design assumptions

### Interactive Graph Visualization in Chat
GRANGER's chat interface goes beyond text conversations⁵:
- **Live D3.js Visualizations**: Interactive graphs render directly in chat
- **Real-Time Graph Updates**: ArangoDB relationships visualize as they change
- **Interactive Exploration**: Click nodes to expand, filter, and traverse relationships
- **Web-Based Responses**: Rich HTML/JavaScript content inline with conversations
- **Memory Visualization**: See conversation history as navigable graph
- **Search Results as Graphs**: Query results display as interactive network diagrams
- **On-Demand Rendering**: Generate custom visualizations from natural language requests
