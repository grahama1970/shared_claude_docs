# GRANGER Competitive Advantages: Solving the Compliance Verification Crisis

## The Problem No One Else Solves Completely

### Market Reality: The Verification Gap
Every aerospace/defense program faces the same expensive problem:
- **Documentation** says one thing (PDFs, PowerPoints, HTML specs, XML schemas)
- **Code** does another (across 30+ languages from COBOL to Rust)
- **Hardware** behaves differently still (live telemetry, sensor data, test results)

Current tools address pieces, but **only GRANGER verifies all three domains** while continuously improving its detection capabilities through autonomous research and reinforcement learning.

4. **Marker**: Multi-format document processing (PDF, PPT, HTML, XML)
5. **ArangoDB**: Graph database for complex relationship mapping
6. **Chat**: Natural language interface for expert queries
7. **YouTube Transcripts**: Technical video content extraction
8. **Claude Max Proxy**: Scalable multi-model AI processing
