## Key Points Covered

### 1. Core Concept
GRANGER uses reinforcement learning to create intelligent, self-improving communication pathways between its 14 specialized modules, achieving:
- 80% faster verification workflows
- 95% accuracy in cross-domain compliance checking
- Continuous improvement without manual intervention

### 2. RL Architecture
- **Central Hub**: claude-module-communicator orchestrates all interactions
- **RL Commons**: Provides state-of-the-art algorithms (DQN, MARL, GNN, MORL)
- **Ollama Integration**: Local LLM for real-time route optimization
- **DeepRetrieval-style Rewards**: Sophisticated reward system encouraging optimal behavior

### 3. How It Works
1. **Request Analysis**: Convert requests to features and build system state
2. **Intelligent Module Selection**: Use RL to find optimal communication paths
3. **Reward Calculation**: Evaluate performance using multi-tier reward system
4. **Continuous Learning**: Collect episodes and improve over time

### 4. Real-World Scenarios
- **Hardware Verification Q&A**: Dynamic orchestration of Marker, Table Processor, Knowledge Base, and Verification Engine
- **Multi-Step Document Processing**: Sequential optimization with conditional routing

### 5. Advanced Techniques
- **Multi-Agent RL (MARL)**: Modules cooperate without central control
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Topology-aware routing
- **Curriculum Learning**: Progressive complexity training
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Balance latency, accuracy, throughput, and cost

### 6. Results
- Average latency reduced from 450ms to 120ms (73% reduction)
- Success rate increased from 82% to 95%
- Throughput increased from 100 to 350 requests/minute
- Resource usage reduced by 35%

### 7. Key Implementation Files Referenced
- RL algorithms in 
- Integration code in 
- Scenario examples demonstrating real-world usage

## Integration with GRANGER Ecosystem
The whitepaper shows how RL enables GRANGER's modules to:
