# ACERT to GRANGER Evolution - Key Points

## Original ACERT Vision (DARPA 2023-2024)
- **Goal**: Automate requirement extraction from documents
- **Promise**: Save 15% of 80,000 engineering hours
- **Method**: Linear pipeline with rule-based threat mapping
- **Scope**: Documents → Requirements → Known threats

## GRANGER Reality (2025)
- **Achievement**: 80% time reduction, 95% accuracy
- **Method**: Self-learning ecosystem with RL-powered orchestration
- **Scope**: Documents + Code + Hardware verification
- **Innovation**: Discovers new verification methods autonomously

## Key Evolutionary Leaps

1. **From Pipeline to Ecosystem**
   - ACERT: Fixed linear flow
   - GRANGER: 14 modules with fluid, learned interactions

2. **From Rules to Learning**
   - ACERT: If-then threat mappings
   - GRANGER: Discovers patterns like visual timing analysis

3. **From Automation to Intelligence**
   - ACERT: Executes predefined tasks
   - GRANGER: Invents new approaches (e.g., checking DefCon talks on YouTube)

4. **From Local to Distributed Intelligence**
   - ACERT: Single LLM on Horus workstation
   - GRANGER: Multi-model collaboration with safe experimentation

## Most Significant Innovation
The Docker container as a learning laboratory where GRANGER safely experiments with module combinations we never imagined, discovering breakthrough verification techniques through millions of autonomous experiments.

## Bottom Line for DARPA
We promised to save time on "grunt work." We delivered a system that redefines what verification means - not just faster, but fundamentally smarter, continuously evolving to stay ahead of emerging threats.
