# Hardware Integration Status - GRANGER

*Created: June 3, 2025*

## Current Status: Phase 2 Roadmap

The GRANGER whitepaper mentions extensive hardware integration capabilities. This document clarifies the current implementation status.

## Claimed Capabilities (Whitepaper)

### Live Hardware Integration
- Real-time telemetry streams (MQTT, custom protocols)
- Sensor data feeds (temperature, pressure, performance metrics)
- Test equipment outputs (oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, spectrum analyzers)
- SCADA/control system data and industrial protocols
- Flight data recorders and black box analysis
- CAN bus and vehicle diagnostic data
- Embedded system logs and trace data

## Actual Implementation Status

### Currently Implemented ✅
- **Document Analysis**: Can analyze hardware specifications in documents
- **Code Analysis**: Can verify hardware-related code
- **Test Results**: Can process hardware test reports
- **Log Analysis**: Can parse hardware logs if provided as files

### Not Yet Implemented ❌
- Direct hardware telemetry ingestion
- Real-time sensor data streams
- Live SCADA integration
- CAN bus connectivity
- Direct test equipment interfaces

## Phase 2 Implementation Plan (Q3 2025)

### Priority 1: Telemetry Framework
1. MQTT broker integration
2. Time-series database (InfluxDB/TimescaleDB)
3. Real-time data pipeline
4. Anomaly detection algorithms

### Priority 2: Protocol Support
1. OPC UA for industrial systems
2. Modbus for SCADA
3. CAN bus libraries
4. Custom protocol adapters

### Priority 3: Analysis Capabilities
1. Real-time anomaly detection
2. Predictive maintenance ML models
3. Performance deviation alerts
4. Hardware-spec compliance checking

## Why This Matters

While GRANGER currently excels at:
- Analyzing hardware documentation
- Verifying hardware-related code
- Processing test results

The live hardware integration will enable:
- Real-time compliance monitoring
- Predictive failure detection
- Live performance optimization
- Immediate spec deviation alerts

## Interim Solution

Until Phase 2 implementation:
1. **Upload hardware logs** as files for analysis
2. **Export telemetry data** to CSV/JSON for processing
3. **Use test reports** for hardware verification
4. **Document specifications** for compliance checking

## Conclusion

GRANGER's current capabilities provide significant value for hardware-software-documentation alignment. The live hardware integration represents the next evolution, planned for Q3 2025 implementation.
