## üéØ For Agents Reading This Directory

### Start Here:
1. Read **002_Granger_Whitepaper_Final.md** for complete GRANGER overview
2. Review **003_Granger_Competitive_Advantages_Research.md** for market positioning
3. Study **004_Granger_Reinforcement_Learning_Integration.md** for RL implementation

### Key Concepts:
- GRANGER verifies alignment between documentation, code, and hardware
- 14 specialized modules work together through RL orchestration
- System self-improves through continuous learning
- Saves 80% verification time with 95% accuracy

### Technical Implementation:
- All footnotes reference actual code in /home/graham/workspace/experiments/
- RL powered by claude-module-communicator + rl_commons
- Modules are fluid and interchangeable based on task needs
- No fixed pipelines - optimal paths discovered through learning
