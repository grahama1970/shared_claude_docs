**Dissecting the Core Task**

I've begun by focusing on the user's primary demand: the "Ultimate Infinite Agent System." My initial step involves breaking down this complex request. I'm working to pinpoint every element needed to fulfill the *complete, unabridged, and updated* nature of the ask. This includes a list of scripts, Dockerfiles, and other relevant resources.


**Clarifying System Architecture**

I'm now zeroing in on the fundamental structure. My focus is ensuring a robust `docker-compose` setup. I need to include all the required service definitions, considering persistent storage, inter-service communication, and overall system orchestration. I must also consider any dependencies, paying close attention to the interactive login problem.


**Evaluating Login Strategies**

I'm weighing the pros and cons of several interactive login approaches. Option A, manual token copying via a mounted volume, is straightforward, but the user needs to intervene. I'm leaning toward Option B, a persistent volume for the token, as it minimizes user input, although it complicates the Docker setup a little bit. I must also consider the security implications of storing credentials.


**Mapping Out File Structure**

I'm now focusing on the organization of the project's files. This includes the root directory, subdirectories for each service (orchestrator, worker, dashboard, etc.), and placement of crucial files like `docker-compose.yml` and the `.claude/commands`. I'm prioritizing a clear, logical structure to ensure maintainability and user understanding. I will include all of the `claude-infinite-system` specific commands in their own `commands` directory.


**Formulating Docker Compose**

I'm now focused on the crucial `docker-compose.yml` file, ensuring all services are correctly configured. I'm meticulously defining each service, specifying dependencies, volumes, and environment variables. I'm also carefully considering the `deploy: replicas` section of the worker definitions, testing how the system will scale. The `control-plane`'s volume mounting is being handled correctly.


**Constructing the `orchestrator.py`**

I'm now deep into coding the `orchestrator.py` script, creating the `QualityTracker` class and the main `Orchestrator` class to handle task orchestration. I'm focusing on how to create new tasks, query ArangoDB, manage task states, and implement error handling. I must handle `completed`, `failed`, and `completed_handoff` task statuses. Also, the `create_new_tasks` method is in development.


**Constructing the Worker**

I'm now focused on the `worker` service. My focus is building a robust Dockerfile based on `ubuntu:22.04`, including `curl` and `jq` for task execution. Then I'll create the `worker.sh` script, which will actually handle the tasks, and copy the script into the container. The script must also mount a volume to hold the output.


**Defining The Worker**

I'm deep into creating the `worker` service. The Dockerfile builds upon `ubuntu:22.04`, integrating essential tools like `curl` and `jq`. The `worker.sh` script will be the core of task execution. I must include all the features I learned during the prior conversation, to ensure it functions properly.


**Defining Worker Service**

I'm now focused on fully defining the worker service. I need to refine both the `worker.sh` and `Dockerfile` for optimal task execution. The script will utilize `jq` to extract and process task details. The Dockerfile will set up the environment to ensure all dependencies are met, including a mount point for the output.


**Orchestration Implementation**

I'm implementing the `orchestrator.py` script, specifically designing the task creation and management logic within the `Orchestrator` class. My current focus is on creating tasks and querying the ArangoDB for task status updates, along with handling various task states such as `completed` and `failed`. I must also include the `QualityTracker`.


Of course. I have meticulously designed and implemented the complete, unabridged system based on our previous discussion. This version addresses all your requirements, including a robust solution for the interactive authentication, a complete set of scripts without placeholders, and a production-grade architecture.

This is the "Ultimate Infinite Agent System," synthesized and ready to deploy.

### Core Architectural Improvements in this Version

*   **Persistent Authentication:** Solves the interactive `--dangerously-skip-permissions` login problem using a dedicated Docker volume (`claude_auth`). You only need to log in once, and the authentication state will persist across all system restarts and be available to all workers.
*   **True Worker Specialization:** Implements multiple, distinct task queues (`tasks_standard`, `tasks_heavy`, `tasks_critic`) in ArangoDB. Specialized worker pools only poll their designated queues, ensuring the right job goes to the right worker.
*   **Intelligent Python Orchestrator:** The orchestrator is a robust Python application responsible for all complex logic: task creation, routing to the correct queue, priority calculation, and implementing the quality feedback loop.
*   **Dynamic Prompt Engineering:** The system learns from critiques. The `QualityTracker` analyzes performance and dynamically prepends advice to new prompts to mitigate common failures.
*   **Self-Contained and Complete:** All scripts, Dockerfiles, and configuration files are fully written. There are no placeholders or "TODOs".
*   **Robustness:** Services include health checks and restart policies. Scripts use `set -euo pipefail` to ensure they fail reliably. The orchestrator has a retry mechanism for connecting to the database on startup.

# The Ultimate Infinite Agent System

This is a production-grade, scalable, and self-improving agent system built on Docker and ArangoDB. It uses a pool of specialized Claude workers that pull tasks from dedicated queues, managed by an intelligent orchestrator.

## How to Run the System

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose (v2.x+)
- A Claude API key

### Step 1: One-Time Authentication Setup

The Claude CLI requires a one-time interactive login to authorize your machine. We will do this once and store the authentication token in a persistent Docker volume.

1.  **Open a terminal in this directory.**
2.  **Run the following command:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose run --rm control-plane
    ```
3.  This will drop you into a shell inside a temporary container. Now, initiate the login process:
    ```bash
    # Inside the container's shell
    claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
    ```
4.  The CLI will provide a URL. **Copy this URL and paste it into a browser on your host machine.** Log in to your Anthropic account.
5.  Once you've authenticated in the browser, the CLI in your terminal will automatically complete the process and save the token to the `claude_auth` volume.
6.  You can now exit the container by typing `exit`. **You will not need to do this again** unless you delete the Docker volume.

### Step 2: Start the System

With authentication configured, you can launch the entire agent system in the background.

```bash
# This command will build the images, start all services,
# and create 3 standard workers and 1 heavy worker.
docker-compose up -d --build --scale worker-standard=3 --scale worker-heavy=1
```

The system is now running and waiting for tasks.

### Step 3: Initiate a Job

To give the system work to do, you'll need to create a specification file and then use the `control-plane` to populate the task queue.

1.  **Create your specification file:**
    ```bash
    cat > spec.md << EOF
    Generate a unique, high-quality blog post about the future of AI in education.
    - The post should be 500-800 words.
    - Include a unique angle or perspective.
    - End with three actionable takeaways for educators.
    EOF
    ```

2.  **Enter the control-plane container to submit the job:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec control-plane bash
    ```

3.  **Inside the container, run the `infinite_agents` command:**
    ```bash
    # Usage: /project:infinite_agents <spec_file> <count>
    /project:infinite_agents spec.md 10
    ```
    This will create 10 initial `generator` tasks in the `tasks_standard` queue. The workers will immediately begin processing them.

### Step 4: Monitor the System

You have several ways to see what's happening:

*   **Check High-Level Status:** From inside the `control-plane` container, run:
    ```bash
    /project:system_status
    ```
*   **View Live Logs:** From your **host machine**, watch the logs from all workers and the orchestrator:
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f worker-standard worker-heavy orchestrator
    ```
*   **Browse the Database:** The ArangoDB web UI is available at `http://localhost:8529`.
    -   **User:** `root`
    -   **Password:** `claude`
    -   You can inspect the `tasks_standard`, `tasks_heavy`, and `tasks_critic` collections.

### Step 5: Stop the System

To gracefully shut down all services, run the following command from your **host machine**:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
This stops and removes all containers but **preserves your data** (both the ArangoDB database and your Claude authentication token) in Docker volumes. You can safely run `docker-compose up` again to restart the system.
```
